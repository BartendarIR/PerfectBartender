**Not Cocktail of the Week #75: Bumbo & Rum Manhattan**  
For this week’s installment of NCotW, I wanted to start honoring my commitment to feature more rum drinks and start by sharing a couple deliciously simple rum cocktails while I slowly acquire the necessary pieces for some proper Tiki drinks. Additionally, with the slowly building backlash against overhyped and overpriced bourbon, now is a great time to start investing in some nice rums and learning to appreciate them to the same respect.  

**Background**  
As an avid reader of David Driscoll’s blog where he shares his thoughts as spirits purveyor for K&L Wine Merchants, when I saw mention of Smuggler’s Cove, an amazing Tiki bar here in San Francisco, following a series of posts on his visit to Guyana and the El Dorado distillery (links below), I paid it special attention, particularly to the recipes included at the end from Martin Cate, owner of Smuggler’s Cove and rum god (holy shit this sentence has so many commas). Smuggler’s Cove is the biggest single account for El Dorado rum in the entire country and this indirect endorsement of El Dorado made getting a bottle of El Dorado for my bar a relatively high priority. I’ve recently fulfilled this by getting a bottle of El Dorado 12, which has allowed me to try some of the cocktails suggested by Martin Cate to feature the unique flavors and character of this demerara rum. Additionally, by returning to the basics for these cocktails, I feel it has helped me gain a better understanding of rum and its potential uses in other classic cocktails.   
The Bumbo cocktail is one of the world’s oldest, yet rather unknown, cocktails. It and its better known cousin, Grog, hail from the Golden Age of Piracy in the 1600s. Grog, the preferred libation of the British Royal Navy following the conquest of Jamaica in 1655, was a solution to many of their problems, which were 1) the difficulty of keeping fresh water on extended voyages, 2) the lack of vitamin C resulting in scurvy, and 3) the propensity of sailors saving their daily rum rations to get drunk. For Grog, rum was diluted with water with a bit of lime to mask the foul taste of stagnant water. Admittedly this drink seems to have been borne of necessity and sounds relatively unappealing. On the other hand, pirates which did not need to sail such long distances, had no worry of scurvy, did not have rules against drunkenness, and had access to better rum, preferred drinking Bumbo, a simple concoction of sweetened rum with nutmeg. The popularity of Bumbo, a stronger and much more palatable cocktail, persisted at least through the mid-1700s, as it has been recorded that George Washington, founding father of the USA, served it to prospective voters while campaigning in 1758.

**Results**  
This is a really pleasant variation on an Old-Fashioned ([NCotW link](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1u7nb3/not_cocktail_of_the_week_52_oldfashioned/) whose lighter body and flavor seems especially well-suited for a warm evening, but whose spice profile can be appropriate for the holiday season. I guess I’m trying to say that this can be a year-round cocktail. In any case, in terms of its taste, I first get very clear notes of sugar, baking spice and vanilla in the nose, which are unsurprising with the components of this drink being an aged demerara rum garnished with nutmeg. On the palate, it is surprisingly light-bodied, in contrast with an Old-Fashioned which feels a bit more substantial, and extremely smooth. The demerara sugar flavor is prominent, with some fruit and spice notes on the finish. I think this is a great way to get familiar with a nice rum as it allows the rum character to really shine through. I’ve also had great success using other aged rums, such as Ron Zacapa 23, for an Old-Fashioned, though using some bitters instead of the nutmeg. I think the nutmeg is a particularly nice touch for a rum-based Old Fashioned as it brings a bit of the familiar Tiki profile to the nose without significantly affecting the rum flavor. 

**Variations**  
As previously mentioned, Grog is a close relative to the Bumbo, which differs by adding a portion of lime juice to help combat scurvy on long sea voyages, but I wanted instead to use this section to look at the other cocktail mentioned in the post from Smuggler’s Cove and conveniently also have a chance to revisit one of my favorite classics, the Manhattan ([NCotW link](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/16pciv/not_cocktail_of_the_week_2_the_manhattan/). Steve Giles, another bartender at Smuggler’s Cove gives his recipe for a Rum Manhattan.  

via Steve Giles, bartender at Smuggler's Cove, 2014    
* 2 oz El Dorado 12 Year Old rum  
* 1 oz sweet vermouth (Dolin recommended)  
* 1 dash Regan’s orange bitters  
* 1 dash Angostura bitters  
Stir, strain.  

I already love Manhattans, it being one of the first cocktails I fell in love with, and using a nice demerara rum in place of rye is a great twist that I’ve only recently appreciated. I chose to garnish mine with some cherries because to me they are an integral part of a Manhattan, but I do note that they appear to be missing in the post on Smuggler’s Cove. I think the suggestion of Dolin Rouge as the sweet vermouth is very wise in this situation as its fruity profile complements rather than competes with the lighter bodied rum which would be the case with the more assertive herbal profile of other vermouth such as Carpano Antica. The nose of my Rum Manhattan is very familiar with the sweet herbal notes from the Dolin Rouge mingling with the Angostura bitters spice profile. I noted a light caramel note peeking through as well. Similar to the Bumbo, I find that this rum is initially very mild on the palate, but gently and smoothly transitions to a robust and full-flavored cocktail. Flavor-wise, it starts with the fruity tang and spice of sweet vermouth before allowing the luscious and full-bodied dark caramel and sugar notes from the rum to shine. The finish is less spicy than the rye Manhattan I am accustomed to and in its place is a pleasant lingering warmth in the mouth. 

**Cheers!**  
Thanks for reading this week’s installment of NCotW. Maybe this will inspire you to go out and pick up a bottle of demerara rum, particularly if you already enjoy either an Old-Fashioned or a Manhattan. As someone relatively uneducated about rum, I’d really love to know what difference in flavor I might expect from the other rums in the El Dorado line and why they prefer using the 8 or 15-year for the Bumbo. If you’d like to support me and further my education, any of the cocktail books on my Amazon wishlist ([link](http://amzn.com/w/LJIN08K4RTJW)) would be well-received and well-timed for my birthday next month. Otherwise, a smaller contribution in the form of reddit gold is always appreciated as I’m on my last month and it helps me keep on top of the weekly discussions. Finally, if you would rather donate your time to support me, I’m always open to guest contributions in which you can share a cocktail near and dear to your own heart. Between the goal of having some Tiki cocktails in NCotW and a special secret side project, we should have an exciting summer. Hope you’ve enjoyed this week’s post, I’ve got a great simple cocktail that has somehow slid under the radar planned for next week, but until then, cheers!
