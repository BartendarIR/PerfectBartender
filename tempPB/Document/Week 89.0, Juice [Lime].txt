**Not Cocktail of the Week #89: Industry Sour**  
Whew, after the whirlstorm of rum cocktails in the NCotW Tiki Edition specials, let’s get back to our usual content. The Tiki Edition posts have been a lot of work and quite long-winded with the special sections focused on different styles of rum (but totally worth learning about), so I’m going to make another concerted effort to make these a bit briefer, both for ease of reading and for my own sanity. This week’s NCotW is a modern invention that is one of my favorite ways to enjoy that brash and incredibly assertive Italian amaro, Fernet Branca.  

**Background**  
The Industry Sour was created by Ted Kilgore, a bartender at Taste in St. Louis, and first posted on Kindred Cocktails in November of 2011. Its name capitalizes on the growing trend of offering a drink purported to be for people who work in the service industry, but really serving to massage the ego of the cocktail aficionado who wants to feel like they appreciate what a “real bartender” appreciates. Regardless, the Industry Sour does cleverly combine two ingredients that bartenders “love” in a surprisingly balanced and palatable fashion and is something I find myself making when the mood for some Fernet Branca strikes.   

**Recipes**  
via Kindred Cocktails, Ted Kilgore, 2011  
* 1 oz Fernet Branca  
* 1 oz Green Chartreuse  
* 1 oz lime juice  
* 1 oz simple syrup  
Shake on ice and strain into a cocktail glass.

**Results**  
This cocktail has a remarkably unique nose from the interplay between the medicinal menthol notes of Fernet Branca and the sweet vegetal/herbal notes of Green Chartreuse. While the inclusion of Fernet Branca in a cocktail usually results in it dominating the final flavor, combining it with the equally assertive flavor of Green Chartreuse, the strong acidic punch of lime juice, and the ability of sugar to dampen bitterness, the resulting cocktail is remarkably balanced. The flavors play impressively well together, starting with a bit of the earthy herbal notes of Fernet Branca up front, which combines harmoniously with Green Chartreuse in the body accompanied in the background by a pleasant sweet and sour note, then finishes with the Green Chartreuse character coming further forward along with the menthol notes of Fernet Branca, giving it a crispness on the finish, and some bitter lime oils. 

**Green Chartreuse**  
I’ve previously written about Green Chartreuse in my post on the [Final Ward](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1d3j41/not_cocktail_of_the_week_16_final_ward/), so check that out if you want to learn more about this ancient liqueur. I haven’t seemed to have written anything about Fernet or Amari in general, which is something I’ll have to remedy this autumn/winter.   

**Cheers!**  
If your home bar is well-stocked enough to have both Fernet Branca and Green Chartreuse, you should definitely try this cocktail, I personally found it instrumental in helping me better appreciate the flavor of Fernet Branca. A pleasantly brief post this week, next week I plan to present a simple cocktail introducing a new ingredient that I’ve been trying to find for a while. I hope some of you can try this week’s cocktail and if you do, please post about it in the comments below. Any other questions, feedback or suggestions as well. Thanks for reading and for all the continued support. Cheers!
