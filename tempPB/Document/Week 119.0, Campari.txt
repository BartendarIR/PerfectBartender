**Not Cocktail of the week #119: The Golden Beautiful (Guest Post)**  
I know that u/hebug said that he was taking a break from Death & Co recipes for a while, but I really wanted to share this wonderful drink with everyone.

**Background**  
The Golden Beautiful is a cocktail created by Thomas Waugh of Death & Co. I like to think of this cocktail as a distant relative of the the Jungle Bird, both are modified sours with tiki leanings which use a small amount of Campari. As an aside, there is a twist on the Jungle Bird which uses passion fruit syrup (1.5 oz. Plantation original dark, 1.5 oz pineapple juice, .5 oz lime juice, .5 oz passion fruit syrup, .25 oz Campari, crushed ice, mint garnish), so I find these two to bear a significant resemblance to one another.


**Recipe**  
Death & Co., Thomas Waugh, 2009  
2 oz reposado tequila  
.75 oz lime juice  
.5 oz vanilla syrup  
.25 oz passion fruit syrup  
.25 oz Campari (I used Gran Classico)  
.5 oz soda water    
garnish: lime zest. 

shake all ingredients except soda water, strain into a rocks glass over one large ice cube, add soda water. Garnish with lime zest.

**Results**  
I think this drink comes together really well. 
On the nose I get lime, vanilla, and agave. Tasting it, the passion fruit syrup, lime, and Campari always go well together creating a sharp, tangy, citrusy character up front, the vanilla syrup blends really nicely with the light spice, pepperiness and agave flavor of the tequila on the finish and the soda water seems to lighten the drink and make it a little brighter. The combination of lime, passion fruit syrup and Campari is one that I've had previously in the [Novara](http://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/2011/03/novara.html) and I really enjoyed it. 

**Technical stuff**  
One of the reasons this drink appealed to me immediately upon finding it was that I had just made batches of both vanilla syrup and passion fruit syrup in order to make some tiki drinks. Like many of you I'm sure, as I started to explore cocktails I was intimidated by the number of ingredients I needed to procure. Many of these seemed prohibitively expensive or difficult to make. Accordingly, I wanted to share my techniques for making these ingredients with you all.

Vanilla syrup in particular seemed to be pretty wasteful. Vanilla beans aren't cheap! But I was able to cobble together a reasonably cost effective method of making it. First I took a large vanilla bean and cut it in half lengthwise then sliced the halves into about 4 pieces each then placed them in a one pint mason jar and covered them in sugar. I left them there for about 2 weeks, agitating it every few days, now when I want to make vanilla syrup I take about 2 oz. of vanilla sugar (making sure to get a couple pieces of vanilla bean) and combine it with 2 oz of water, heat until the sugar is dissolved and I have a small batch of vanilla syrup without wasting an entire vanilla bean.

Passion fruit syrup is even easier and I'm sure many of you already use this method. I just buy Goya frozen passion fruit pulp for about three dollars at a mexican grocery store, break off a piece, melt it, strain out the chunks, measure it and add an equal amount of sugar, then heat slightly and stir until the sugar is dissolved.

**Cheers!**

I was very happy to share this drink with you today, it's definitely a valuable addition to my growing collection of recipes. I appreciate that it compliments the base spirit so well, and it's definitely a crowd-pleaser. Thanks for reading this, and thanks to u/hebug for letting me host this week's Not Cocktail of the Week. Also, thanks to u/just_a_talking_head for taking these excellent pictures.
