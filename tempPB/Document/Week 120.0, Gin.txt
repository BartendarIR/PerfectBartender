**Not Cocktail of the Week #119: Saturn**  
Well, it’s certainly been a while since my last NCotW, over 2 months actually, though /u/daley42 did an amazing job with his guest post last month on the [Golden Beautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/3hrfsx/not_cocktail_of_the_week_119_the_golden_beautiful/). Apologies for the infrequency of NCotW recently, I’ve had much less free time recently due to a new job. Luckily, things seem to be settling down and I hope I will have a little more time to devote towards sharing great cocktails with this community. For this week’s NCotW, I want to share a recent unusual Tiki discovery that I found particularly delicious, the gin-based Saturn.  

**Background**  
The Saturn was created at the Kona Kai in Huntington Beach by J. “Popo” Galsini, a well-respected Tiki bartender who worked at many Orange County Polynesian restaurants from the 1950s and 60s. The Saturn cocktail was originally known as the X-15, named after the rocket plane that still holds the world record for highest speed reached by a manned, powered aircraft at 4,520 miles per hour (7,274 km/h) or Mach 6.72. According to Beachbum Berry, J. “Popo” Galsini named the X-15 in honor of Douglas Aircraft engineers that drank at the Kona Kai, however according to the Wikipedia article on the [X-15 rocket plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_X-15) it was not manufactured by Douglas Aircraft, but North American Aviation in Los Angeles, CA and Reaction Motors in New Jersey. That said, [North American Aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Aviation) was initially run by [James H. “Dutch” Kindelberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Kindelberger), who was recruited from the [Douglas Aircraft Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Aircraft_Company), so it seems possible that he brought a number of engineers along with him and that it is these engineers referenced in this story. J. “Popo” Galsini renamed the X-15 to the Saturn in 1967 following a tragic accident during [X-15 Flight 191](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-15_Flight_3-65-97) resulting in the death of U.S. Air Force test pilot Major Michael J. Adams.  
According to Beachbum Berry, the renamed Saturn cocktail went on to win first place in the California Bartenders’ Guild contest and later the International Bartender’s Association (IBA) World Cocktail Championship (WCC) that year. However, according to the IBA publication in 2011 “Sixty Years On” commemorating the 60th anniversary of the IBA (which can be found [here](http://documents.mx/documents/cocktail-iba-sixty-years.html), the winner of the 1967 WCC held in Mallorca (Majorca), Spain was Enrique Bastante with a completely different rum-based cocktail. In fact, I could not find any mention of the Saturn in this publication at all. I was also unable to find any records for the California Bartenders’ Guild. While I am loath to question the story put forth by Beachbum Berry, I do find a couple inconsistencies in the story about the Saturn and wonder whether I am missing something. I also find it disappointing that all the other articles and posts about the Saturn blindly quote this story without bothering to even attempt to verify any facts despite the immeasurable resources of the internet at our fingertips.  
Regardless of its origin story, the Saturn does remain a beautiful cocktail worthy of our appreciation. I personally discovered the Saturn on a trip to Three Dots and a Dash in Chicago, IL. My wife and I really enjoy food tourism so on our brief trip, I also managed to visit Aviary (duh) and Billy Sunday on /u/AlmightyJ ‘s recommendation. I’ll have to share my thoughts on those places another time. In any case, the Saturn was recommended to her as she loves passion fruit and it ended up being her favorite cocktail on the entire trip, so I obviously had to replicate it once I got home.

**Results**  
As my aim was to replicate the Saturn at Three Dots and a Dash, I did not follow the recipe from Beachbum Berry exactly. While the official recipe calls for it to be blended until smooth, the Saturn I had at Three Dots and a Dash seemed to be on more roughly crushed ice, though it could have been briefly blended on a spindle blender (I was not seated at the bar to witness). Additionally, it was not served in a Pilsner glass, but more of a short goblet so I elected to use my rounded rocks glass. Given the incredible diversity of glassware available at Three Dots and a Dash, I’m sure this was an intentional choice. Finally, the original recipe simply calls for gin, but the ingredients list at Three Dots and a Dash lists Navy strength gin, so I used the Genius Navy strength gin I had on hand. I purchased the Genius Navy strength gin (and a number of other products) mostly on the recommendation of David Driscoll, spirits buyer for K&L Wine Merchants. I follow his [blog](http://spiritsjournal.klwines.com/) closely and happened to stumble across this [post](http://spiritsjournal.klwines.com/klwinescom-spirits-blog/2015/5/14/white-nights.html) when I was in the market for a Navy strength gin. Anyways, I find it is an unusual gin that is not particularly juniper-forward, with more of a soft, sweet and perfume-y character. I think this worked extremely well for the Saturn, allowing the passion fruit to shine while bolstering it with a botanical complexity. Speaking of passion fruit, the passion fruit syrup I used for this drink was equal parts Perfect Puree passion fruit concentrate and simple cane syrup.  
My Saturn started with a nose of tart passion fruit and lemon complemented by citrus notes from the gin. On the palate, I first got the sweet floral gin up front, fruity tart passion fruit in the body, and a return of the mild gin for the finish. The contributions from the falernum and orgeat were more difficult to find, but I did note a mild creamy character that I attribute to orgeat. Overall the Saturn is deceptively drinkable considering the use of Navy strength gin with an intense fruit flavor. I was very pleased with the results of this Saturn, it replicated our memory of the Three Dots and a Dash very well and will be a cocktail to make any time I have passion fruit syrup. As a final note, I’m not entirely sure how this drink will be with a drier juniper-forward gin, so in terms of more common gins, I would suggest either the citrus-forward Plymouth or possibly the floral Hendrick’s if you make this at home.    

**Cheers!**  
Hope you’ve enjoyed this week’s NCotW, again apologies for my relative scarcity, it has been difficult to find 4-6 free hours (and liver capacity) to put towards this hobby recently, but I hope to be contributing to this community more often in the near future. Please leave your questions and feedback in the comments section below and if you enjoy NCotW, consider supporting reddit and this column with some reddit gold. Hopefully I’ll be back soon, but until then, cheers!
