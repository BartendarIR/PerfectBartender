**Not Cocktail of the Week #6: Ramos Gin Fizz**  
I elected to have my NCotW post take place a early to allow you to prepare a cocktail for Fat Tuesday, the big party day associated with Mardi Gras. DrammingSpeed (where is that guy now anyways?) previously wrote up the Sazerac, another famous classic cocktail originating from new Orleans, in his Cocktail of the Week series [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/14qgow/cocktail_of_the_week_2_sazerac/), so for this week’s column, I will write about another famous cocktail from New Orleans, the Ramos Gin Fizz. Also testing a new format, let me know what you think!

**Background**  
The Ramos Gin Fizz originates from 1888 by Henry C. Ramos in New Orleans first at the Meyer’s Table d’Hotel Internationale before he brought it with him to the Imperial Cabinet Saloon. One of the city’s most venerated cocktails, it was originally called the New Orleans Fizz and due to the time-consuming nature of making this drink, despite having over twenty “bartenders” (essentially human paint shakers in this case) working assembly line style, they were barely able to meet demand. After Ramos took over the Stag saloon in 1907, he continued to serve his famous fizz until Prohibition was enacted. His fizz was so popular that customers would wait as long as an hour to get their hands on an authentic Ramos Fizz. At Mardi Gras in 1915, it was reported that “35 shaker boys nearly shook their arms off, but still were unable to keep up with demand”.  
Of course, when Prohibition was enacted, the cocktail scene changed but luckily in this case, the popularity of the Ramos Gin Fizz was brought back by the 40th governor of Louisiana and later member of the US Senate, Huey P. Long aka “The Kingfish”. It turns out that “The Kingfish” was very fond of the Ramos Gin Fizz as he had the head bartender of the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans (to which Henry Ramos sold his rights to the name after the repeal of Prohibition), Sam Guarino, travel to New York with him in 1935 to teach the staff there how to make it. There is newsreel footage of this cocktail at this event where he lambasted President Roosevelt’s New Deal, which obviously played a large part in introducing this famous cocktail to the world and immortalizing it (photo [here](http://imgur.com/CSRCIWL). Nowadays, the Roosevelt Hotel is the Fairmont and one can still stop in and have an authentic Ramos Gin Fizz if one is in the vicinity.

**Results**  
Instead of the usual Beefeater London dry gin called for in the PDT recipe, I elected to use Hendrick’s gin, a unique dry gin made in Scotland that is known for the addition of Bulgarian rose and cucumber to its flavor. I felt that its light floral characteristics would meld well with the fruity and airy profile of this cocktail.  
Making this cocktail is EXHAUSTING. The last time I made this cocktail I did a minute dry shake followed by a minute shake on ice. In an attempt to be more authentic, this time I managed a 5 minute dry shake, followed by a full minute shake on ice. I’ve never tried the Shake Weight®, but I can definitely see how it works after making the Ramos Gin Fizz as my upper arms and shoulders are very tired. Note to self: Shake Weight® as an exercise to increase a bartenders’ stamina?  
The cocktail itself is really quite delicious and unique, a very smooth and creamy texture that blends seamlessly with the fruitiness of citrus and orange flower water. Not too sweet, not bracingly sour, this is a very pleasant cocktail that I wish I had made a double recipe for since it goes by much too fast for all of the work that goes into it. You can definitely understand why Ramos needed so many shaker boys for this.  
One trick that I tried was to pour my seltzer water on the remnants of the cocktail left in the shaker tin to generate foam and then add that additional foam to the cocktail. Unfortunately, I did not let my water chill sufficiently before charging with carbon dioxide, so there is not as much foam as expected, but it was nonetheless a rewarding experience.  

**Variations**  
Other than the inherent variation from recipe to recipe, the only variation I came across was the addition of vanilla extract in addition to the orange flower water which presumably results in a sweeter and creamier experience. Some believe that vanilla extract is a “secret ingredient” that Ramos included in his cocktail, but given the color it imparts, it would be difficult to hide. The *Time Magazine* recipe, is the only one which calls for Old Tom gin, which might be an interesting variation, though my arms do not have the fortitude required to do a side-by-side tasting, I would be interested in hearing your experience if anyone manages to make it. 

**Egg Whites**  
Fizzes are an underappreciated class of cocktails, partially due to the relatively time-consuming and laborious preparation. The extra effort involved in emulsifying the ingredients can be bypassed by using an immersion blender or potentially a blender, but primarily their decline in popularity is due to public health concerns. It’s unfortunate that people are afraid of trying traditional cocktails containing egg whites which give a unique silky mouthfeel and can help smooth some of the rougher edges of a cocktail, melding the flavors together better. As we all know, the concern with using raw eggs is potential contamination with Salmonella, a bacteria that can cause food poisoning. At last report, the CDC estimated that approximately [1 in 20,000](http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/salmonella_enteritidis/) eggs is contaminated with Salmonella, an individuals’ risk of contracting Salmonella at [11.3 in 100,000](http://www.breakingtheviciouscycle.info/knowledge_base/detail/salmonella-in-eggs-weighing-up-the-risks/), and given that the type on eggs only accounts for 17.7% of Salmonella, it’s basically less than a 1 in 100,000 chance that consumption of raw eggs over the course of a year will result in food poisoning. Still, it’s higher than getting hit by lightning (1 in 280,000 for reference). If you’re that unlucky, you may want to try using powdered pasteurized egg whites. Hopefully if you’re daring enough to venture out during a thunderstorm, you’ll try a traditional Ramos Gin Fizz or a whiskey sour with some raw egg white.

**Cheers!**  
Hope you all have a safe Mardi Gras and will have an opportunity to kick off Fat Tuesday with a Ramos Gin Fizz; or if you’re not observing Lent, use one Wednesday morning to battle that hangover; and if you’re really adventurous, have them both days!
