**Not Cocktail of the Week #117: Water Lily**  
Apologies everyone, it’s been a while since my last NCotW post, but work has been pretty chaotic lately and I haven’t had the time to find any new cocktails worth writing about. Since my last post on the [Kingston Negroni](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/38e4cc/not_cocktail_of_the_week_116_kingston_negroni/) I’ve acquired some crème de violette and wanted to find a tasty cocktail using it to write about. While the go-to standard cocktail for crème de violette is the Aviation, I actually found it a little disappointing as the crème de violette seems to be included primarily for its color and the end result tastes to me like a hollow off-balance Last Word with the combination of gin and maraschino liqueur. Later, a friend looking for recipes using crème de violette came across the Water Lily cocktail and shared it with me. Ultimately my friends and I found the Water Lily much more agreeable, so I decided to write about it for NCotW.

**Background**  
The creation of the Water Lily is attributed to Richard Boccato in 2007, during his tenure as bartender at Little Branch in New York City. Described as a “floral variant on the venerable Corpse Reviver #2”, it uses equal parts of gin, Cointreau, and lemon juice, but replaces the Lillet for crème de violette and omits the absinthe. According to the blurb in *The PDT Cocktail Book*, it is named after “a dear friend of Richard’s whose middle name is ‘Lily’.” While I’m sure many cocktails created on a nightly basis and named after a woman, few make its way into a notable tome of cocktail recipes.

**Results**  
The Water Lily really highlights what crème de violette can bring to a drink. It starts with a perfumed aroma of sweet flowers and citrus oils. In the mouth it has a full-bodied texture that opens with the bright and tart citrus flavors of lemon and orange. It then transitions to the sweet flower notes of crème de violette and mild citrusy Plymouth gin in the body before finishing with gin botanicals, a heady floral note and orange oil. Something about this combination of flavors evokes candy in my mind at first, but becomes more complex later. This is one of those sour style cocktails that is really best enjoyed while fresh and ice cold from the shaker. I could tell that by the time I finished the drink, its balance had shifted, tasting sweeter and more floral which, while preventing palate fatigue, could easily become overwhelming.  

**Crème de Violette**  
It’s been a while since I’ve picked up a new ingredient to write one of these special sections, but I wanted to learn a bit more about crème de violette and figured I might as well share my findings. Crème de violette is the generic term for a neutral spirit or brandy-based liqueur flavored and/or colored with natural or artificial violet flowers. I’ve always wondered why certain liqueurs are prefixed with “crème” and why they didn’t seem to be cream-based like Kahlua or Bailey’s. According to [The Straight Up blog](http://drinkstraightup.com/2013/04/15/creme-de-violette/), the term “crème” is in reference to how the added sugar gives it a creamy texture but then why aren’t all liqueurs considered crème? As far as I can tell, crème liqueurs have a much higher sugar content, but I’m not sure if there’s any strict rule defining it.  
Crème de violette is flavored with the violet flower or *Viola odorata* and for the Rothman & Winter offering specifically, the Queen Charlotte and March varieties are used. Violets are not widely grown any longer, though many years ago they were commonly sold in flower stalls as nosegays (the world was once a lot stinkier). These flowers get their unique aroma and flavor from the chemical compound ionone which a minority of people experience as a soapy flavor rather than floral (much like the oft-mentioned unique experiences of cilantro haters). You can read a little more about violets and their use in cocktails in Amy Stewart’s *The Drunken Botanist*.  
While relatively scarce ten years ago, the modern cocktail revival has yielded a surprising number of options for crème de violette though the Rothman & Winter offering seems to be the standard for cocktails. Previous offerings such as Crème Yvette and Parfait Amour have some violet flavor, but are blended with a variety of other flavors ranging from berries, citrus, vanilla and spices. Additionally they do not impart the striking color that is expected of a crème de violette. Check out a comparison between Rothman & Winter crème de violette and Crème Yvette courtesy of The Straight Up [here](http://drinkstraightup.com/2013/05/23/side-by-side-violette-yvette/). Tempus Fugit and Bitter Truth now also offer a “violet liqueur”, but I can’t really see the advantage of using one of these over Rothman & Winter. Still, if you are interested, there is a comparison between the two found [here](http://bitterchris.com/cocktail-face-off-creme-de-violette/).   


**Cheers!**  
If you’ve gone to the trouble to get the ingredients for an Aviation, then you definitely shouldn’t have any trouble putting together a Water Lily. You may even find you prefer it over the Aviation, like I did. Again apologies for the relative infrequent posts recently, I’ve regrettably found myself with fewer opportunities to drink new and interesting cocktails, but NCotW will still continue! I still have much to learn and hope to continue sharing it here with you all. As usual any feedback or discussion is welcome in the comments section below. In particular, feel free to share other favorite recipes utilizing crème de violette or any cocktails you’d like to potentially see in NCotW. Until next time friends, cheers!
