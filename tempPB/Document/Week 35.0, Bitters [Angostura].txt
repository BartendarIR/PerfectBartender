**Not Cocktail of the Week #35: Corpse Reviver No. 1**  
Now that Labor Day has passed, autumn is just around the corner for most of America and Europe, but in the anomaly that is San Francisco, our Indian summer has just begun. In any case, as the seasons change, so do the cocktails I find myself turning to and for this week’s NCotW, I want to share a classic cocktail that I find ideal for sipping and enjoying in autumn, the Corpse Reviver No. 1. I previously wrote about the more popular Corpse Reviver No. 2 a while ago [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/17555c/not_cocktail_of_the_week_3_corpse_reviver_2/), but now let’s take a look at her(?) completely distinct and less popular older brother(?).   

**Background**  
As indicated by their name, the Corpse Reviver cocktails are intended as “hair of the dog” hangover remedies (though their efficiency at this task seems questionable). The Corpse Reviver No. 1, found in *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, is noted to be “taken before 11 am, or whenever steam and energy are needed.” Immediately following in the note for the Corpse Reviver No. 2, “Note: Four of these taken in swift succession will unrevive the corpse again.” Perhaps you were meant to wake up with a hangover, chase it away with a Corpse Reviver No. 1 and then return to your previous drunken state with the Corpse Reviver No. 2? I’ve never considered trying them in succession, they seem like such different drinks, but who knows. All I can say is that I’m not sure how much steam or energy I’d be producing after a few of either of these.

**Results**  
The first time I made a Corpse Reviver No. 1, I went with Gary Regan’s *Joy of Mixology* recipe, but since I now have Laird’s bonded apple brandy, which is a higher proof than their applejack, I tweaked the recipe slightly to compensate, dropping the applejack component from 2 oz to 1.5 oz. This version of the Corpse Reviver No. 1 has an intensely fruity nose in which I detect notes of apple, flowers, oak and herbs. On the palate, the fruitiness is not as intense and less apparent, instead carrying a juicy sensation and tasting most strongly of brandy with a slight maltiness and surprising bitterness. Though I can’t see how this is supposed to “invigorate” me, I definitely feel like this is a solid “brown drink” suitable for sipping in autumn.  
The addition of bitters (as seen in the Bartender’s Choice spec and suggested by Erik Ellestad of Savoy Stomp) is surprisingly pleasant, making a significant shift in the nose of this cocktail, the spice notes it adds makes the aroma very “wintery” with intensified notes of apple, spice, and delicious baked goods. I also found bitters to help further meld the flavors of this cocktail together, giving it a rounder mouthfeel, a warmer feeling, and a mild dryness on the finish.  
The Savoy recipe which emphasizes the cognac component rather than the apple brandy is a bit smoother and still very fruity, though comparatively lacking in the apple character that I think makes this cocktail unique. It has a much sharper nose with some spice characteristic and its flavor is mostly that of cognac though tempered with a little apple fruit and ending with a dry finish. 

**Variations**  
As you can see from the varied recipes, though its base ingredients don’t change, the dominant ingredient in a Corpse Reviver No. 2 can swing between applejack and brandy. Feel free to play with that ratio depending on how much you enjoy each respective spirit and whether you are using applejack or apple brandy. The more modern addition of some bitters is also a nice variation and I think adds a pleasant amount of depth while helping blend the flavors together.  

**The History of Applejack and Apple Brandy**  
Applejack is a truly underappreciated spirit given its history. Its invention significantly predates the invention of what we know of today as bourbon whiskey, thanks to William Laird, who emigrated from Scotland to America in 1698 and used his experience as a distiller to produce applejack from the abundant apple trees planted in America. There is written documentation of George Washington writing to the Laird family asking for their recipe for applejack prior to 1760 and it played an integral role in America’s Independence, as it was consumed by the soldiers at Valley Forge, helping to keep them fortified and warm over the brutal winter. In 1780, following the Revolutionary War, Robert Laird was granted the first commercial distillery license in the newly formed United States. Over the next century or so, applejack continued to play a big role in American culture, associated with such figures as John Chapman aka “Johnny Appleseed”, who in addition to planting a lot of apple trees, taught people how to make applejack; and Abraham Lincoln, who served it in his Illinois tavern prior to being President.  
Applejack, as its name would imply, was traditionally made in America by crushing fresh apples to make apple cider, allowing it to ferment naturally into hard cider, then “distill” it by keeping it outdoors during the cold winter, which would freeze the water and concentrate the applejack to 30-40% alcohol. This process of freeze distillation was also known as "jacking", which also contributes to the name applejack. Since this is no longer practical for the production of large amounts of applejack, it is now distilled in a more traditional fashion using stills, but it is still produced from naturally fermented apple cider. According to the Laird’s website, it takes 7,000 pounds of apples to produce a barrel of apple brandy, which translates to 6 pounds of apples for a bottle of applejack, or 20 pounds for a bottle of bonded apple brandy. It should be noted and is obvious from that difference that Laird’s applejack is not made entirely from apples and is in fact only 35% apple brandy, the rest being mixed with neutral grain spirit. Both are comprised of apple brandy that have been aged in charred oak barrels, but they typically use apple brandy aged 4-6 years in their applejack, while their bonded apple brandy is aged 6-10 years. These two facts make the bonded apple brandy a much superior product, if you can get your hands on it, but that said the applejack is still very suitable for cocktails as well. 

**Cheers!**  
Hopefully you have a chance to try the Corpse Reviver No. 1, though I would personally not recommend it first thing in the morning, and also learned a bit from the section I finally wrote about applejack, a uniquely American spirit. Thanks to all who sent in recipes and suggestions for cocktails with Green Chartreuse last week, hopefully I’ll be featuring some of them in the near future. In the meantime, if you’re interested in sharing one of your own personal favorite cocktails, feel free to contact me and we can arrange a time for a guest post. As usual, your comments, suggestions, questions, and support are all welcome. Cheers!

PS: a bit of a rush job this week, I was struggling to get a satisfactory Deauville cocktail for NCotW, so hopefully there aren't too many typos or bad grammar.
