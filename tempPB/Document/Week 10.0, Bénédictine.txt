**Not Cocktail of the Week #10: Vieux Carré**  
Thanks so much to /u/wallunit for volunteering to write the NCotW post last week. I, for one, appreciated the short break. I thought this week I would revisit Bénédictine and write about another classic from New Orleans, the Vieux Carré cocktail.

**Background**  
The Vieux Carré cocktail was invented in the 1930s by the head bartender at the Hotel Monteleone in New Orleans, Walter Bergeron. Its name comes from the French term for the French Quarter of New Orleans, le Vieux Carré, where the Hotel Monteleone resides. It is said that this cocktail was created to pay tribute to the different ethnicities that came together to form New Orleans. The use of cognac and Bénédictine is a nod to the French, the use of rye whiskey is to the Americans, the sweet vermouth to the Italians, the Angostura bitters to the Carribbean, and the Peychaud’s bitters a credit to the city of New Orleans herself. The Hotel Monteleone still stands today, though the original bar has been replaced by an iconic carousel that actually slowly turns, so if you’re ever visiting New Orleans, this would definitely be a bar worth visiting for a classic cocktail or two.

**Recipes**  
From the *PDT Cocktail Book*  
* 1 oz. Sazerac 6-year-old rye whiskey  
* 1 oz. Hine V.S.O.P. cognac  
* 1 oz Carpano Antica sweet vermouth  
* 0.25 oz Bénédictine  
* 1 dash Angostura bitters  
* 1 dash Peychaud’s bitters  
Stir with ice and strain over one large cube into a chilled rocks glass. No garnish.

The recipe I favor from [gumbopages.com](http://www.gumbopages.com/food/beverages/vieux-carre.html)  
* 1 oz rye whiskey (Bulleit rye)  
* 1 oz cognac (Remy Martin VSOP)  
* 1 oz sweet vermouth (Dolin Rouge)  
* 1 tsp Bénédictine  
* 2 dashes Peychaud’s bitters  
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters  
Mix all ingredients in an old-fashioned glass over ice; stir.

**Results**  
Although I should also sample this cocktail on the rocks, I often find myself enjoying this cocktail neat. Because it shares a backbone with my preferred cocktail, the rye Manhattan, its profile is similar but significantly more complex. It’s definitely high on the list of favorite cocktails if it were easier to order in a restaurant, but for now I will continue to enjoy them at home. I find the Vieux Carré starts off quite fruity in both the nose and initial notes on the tongue, which can be attributed to the cognac. It then matures into the familiar flavors of a rye Manhattan before the herbal notes of Bénédictine kick in. The finish is a spicy and complex bitterness as I have a rather heavy hand with my dashes. In the end I find this a very palatable cocktail to sip and savor.

**Variations**  
Obviously, this is intended to be served on the rocks, but I enjoy the Manhattan-like qualities of this drink so I tend to have it neat. Some people incorporate a lemon twist garnish, and although the original recipe doesn’t call for it, I feel like it could be a nice touch and add a light citrus element to the fruity nose. As a classic cocktail, it’s hard to mess with the well-thought-out proportions, but I think some variation might be possible by substituting the cognac portion with a different brandy, such as applejack or pisco? If anyone has the courage and materials to give that a shot, let me know in the comments. 

**Peychaud’s Bitters**  
As I have written about some of the most popular cocktails utilizing Peychaud’s bitters, I thought this might be my last chance in the near future to briefly talk about Peychaud’s bitters. Peychaud’s bitters were first formulated around the 1830s by Antoine Amédée Peychaud, a Creole apothecary from Haiti that settled in New Orleans. As a gentian-based bitter, it is similar to Angostura, but as obvious from the color, it is a bit lighter and in my experience, adds a spicier note. On top of the usual bitter, spicy and herbal notes associated with cocktail bitters, people often find cherry and anise notes in Peychaud’s bitters. Peychaud’s bitters used to be difficult to obtain outside of New Orleans, but with the increasing popularity of craft cocktails, I find it is reasonable to find it in your local specialty grocery store. Getting it outside of the USA is reportedly much more difficult though.  

Originally, bitters were marketed as medicinal products, often used to treat stomach maladies like indigestion and nausea. Nowadays, in addition to serving as the “salt and pepper” of cocktails, they are treated as apértifs and digestifs and can be taken to either stimulate the appetite before a meal, or to settle one’s stomach afterwards. I do find myself reaching for bitters when I have overeaten and need to settle my stomach taking 2-5 dashes and topping off with soda water. 

**Cheers!**  
Hope you’ve enjoyed the regular /r/cocktails column. If you’ve taken the time to invest in a bottle of Bénédictine, hopefully you’ve gotten a chance to use it over the course of the previous cocktails (#1 and #4) and found it worth your while. Let me know in comments what you think about the Vieux Carré and if anyone else is interested in taking a shot at writing a post, send me a message and we can work something out.
