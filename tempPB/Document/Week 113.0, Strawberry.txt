**Not Cocktail of the Week #113: Muddled Mission**  
Surprise! NCotW two weeks in a row! It’s much less research writing about these modern drinks from *Death + Co.* that I’ve been enjoying over the past few months, so I’m going to try and occasionally have NCotW in subsequent weeks. Following last week’s post on the [Old Ironsides](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/33i34n/not_cocktail_of_the_week_112_old_ironsides/), a delicious stirred cocktail utilizing dark and molasses-y black strap rum, this week I wanted to go in a completely different direction and share a shaken drink bursting with fresh fruit character, the Muddled Mission.  

**Background**  
There’s much less background to discuss this week, but the Muddled Mission is credited to Joaquín Simó in 2008 at Death + Co. He is better known for creating the [Latin Quarter](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2vkgdm/not_cocktail_of_the_week_107_latin_quarter/) and opening Pouring Ribbons in New York City, but both these drinks illustrate his mastery of the craft.  
Immediately after discovering the Muddled Mission, I came across the [Resting Point]( http://www.kindredcocktails.com/cocktail/resting-point) from *The PDT Cocktail Book*, which also utilizes the combination of strawberry and Yellow Chartreuse. However, the Resting Point is a tequila-based cocktail with sweet vermouth. Still, I find the shared combination of strawberry and Yellow Chartreuse between the two drinks rather intriguing and while I can’t logically figure out why they complement each other well, I feel that they do. Perhaps by sharing this, some others will try something new using those flavors.  

**Recipes**  
*Death & Co.*, David Kaplan, 2014  
* 1 strawberry  
* 1.5 oz Anchor Junipero gin  
* 1 oz St. Germain  
* 0.75 oz lemon juice  
* 0.25 oz Yellow Chartreuse  
Garnish: 1 strawberry
In a shaker, gently muddle the strawberry. Add the remaining ingredients and shake with ice. Strain into a coupe. Garnish with the strawberry. 

*Links and Further Reading*  
Yet again, there are no links because nobody else has written about this one yet.  

**Results**  
This is a dangerously tempting cocktail with fresh and sweet strawberry notes immediately greeting you in the nose. The sweet fruity aroma is enhanced by the crowd pleasing St. Germain and is accompanied by a mild herbal juniper note from the gin. Upon sipping, the Muddled Mission is thick and full-bodied with a luscious texture in the mouth imparted by the muddled strawberry. I found that the progression of flavor started with fresh strawberry similarly enhanced as in the nose by sweet fruity St. Germain flavor. The mildly tart and fresh lemon component showed up in the middle combining and balancing the fruity sweetness before a brief gin component at the end. The finish has lingering complex herbal notes from the gin and Yellow Chartreuse. I found that this cocktail bordered on being overly sweet, but your results may vary depending on how large and sweet of a strawberry you use. I personally would consider dropping the St. Germain component a quarter ounce, but that is my personal preference.  

**Variations**  
In making these cocktails from *Death + Co.*, I’ve been pushing myself out of my comfort zone and trying to apply their concepts or flavor pairings to create new variations on their cocktails. This week I used their framework and the flavor combination of strawberry and Yellow Chartreuse in something I’ve called the Muddled Sunset. For the Muddled Sunset, I first switched the dry juniper-forward gin for a bright fruity American brandy. I previously quite enjoyed the combination of Yellow Chartreuse with brandy in the [Champs Elysees](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/209moq/not_cocktail_of_the_week_62_champs_%C3%A9lys%C3%A9es/), so this seemed like an appropriate pairing. As I felt the fruity brandy and St. Germain would either compete with each other or make the drink too one note, I replaced Rob Cooper’s St. Germain with his brother John Cooper’s Domain de Canton ginger liqueur (I bet you didn’t know they were related [link](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123578523945698543)). While I’m not sure where Joaquín Simó found inspiration for his name, but with the Mission neighborhood of San Francisco nearby, I named mine after another neighborhood, the Sunset. With its deep red color evoking the sunset and ginger reflecting the large Asian community in the neighborhood, this seemed like a fitting name.  
* 1 strawberry  
* 1.5 oz Paul Masson VSOP brandy  
* 0.75 oz Domain de Canton ginger liqueur  
* 0.75 oz lemon juice  
* 0.25 oz Yellow Chartreuse 
Garnish: 1 strawberry 

Compared to the Muddled Mission, while the Muddled Sunset has obvious parallels, the difference is immediately apparent from the nose. Rather than fresh bright strawberry, the Muddled Sunset has a heady strawberry aroma packed with rich fruit and a jam-like quality. The texture of the two drinks are similar, but the flavor reflects the same differences apparent in the nose. In place of fresh strawberry, I first get a rich and full-bodied fruitiness from the combination of brandy and strawberry. In the body, the lemon note is a bit milder as it combines with brandy instead of gin. Despite the relatively large proportion of Domain de Canton, its mildly spicy and bright ginger flavor surprisingly does not appear until the end of the drink. The finish is relatively clean with a few lingering strawberry and orange notes. The flavors of this drink feel a bit better suited for the transition between summer to fall with the brandy and ginger, but I felt this drink was reasonably successful. I believe in light of the Resting Point, a tequila version of this could also work. 

**Cheers!**  
As usual, thanks for reading this week’s NCotW. I hope that some of you might have the opportunity to try and maybe even be inspired by the interesting combination of strawberry and Yellow Chartreuse. As mentioned in last week’s post, I’d love to have more guest contributions since it would result in more NCotW for everybody. Whether you want a time to post one with my help or you want to send in some material for me to edit and post, I’m open to either possibility. Other than that, please leave your comments and feedback on this week's cocktail below. Cheers!
