**Not Cocktail of the Week #44: Godfather**  
Though this week’s cocktail, the Godfather, is an official IBA recognized after-dinner cocktail, it is oft-maligned partially due to its origins and it being overly sweet. As I occasionally find myself craving a simple after-dinner cocktail that doesn’t require much work, I thought it would be worth revisiting the Godfather and trying a more modern version. I was pleasantly surprised at how it turned out and so I thought it was worth sharing with the rest of you.

**Background**  
Our perception of cocktails in the 1960s is likely colored primarily by AMC’s TV show *Mad Men*, which portrays it as a classic era of heavy drinking with 3 Martinis at lunch, pours of whiskey at the office, and Old-Fashioneds or Manhattans in the evening [disclaimer: I have only seen a couple episodes of *Mad Men*]. Yet this was also the era in which vodka was becoming more and more popular, with the advent of the Moscow Mule in the late 1950s and James Bond’s first vodka martini in 1962. The cocktails drink in this era seemed to be either a timeless classic or a horrible concoction (such as the Blue Hawaiian or Pink Squirrel). It was also perhaps the time in history that started the “fruit salad” Old-Fashioned, with the 1956 *Esquire Drink Book* calling for muddling of a slice each of orange, lemon, pineapple, as well as a maraschino cherry, and administers the coup de grace by topping this concoction with club soda. It was in this setting that the Godfather cocktail arose and though there is no singular creator of this cocktail that I could find, most believe it was named after Marlon Brando, who played the titular character of the movie The Godfather, Don Vito Corleone. Apparently this was Marlon Brando’s drink of choice, so in honor of his role and given the significant contribution of the Italian liqueur amaretto, it was called the Godfather. 

**Recipes**

* 2.25 oz bourbon  
* 0.5 oz amaretto  
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters  
Add ingredients to glass, add ice and stir 5-6 times  

**Results**  
*a dusty classic*  
*reimagined with bourbon*  
*almond old-fashioned*  
Though the original version calls for equal parts scotch whiskey and amaretto, my teeth started to hurt just thinking about it, so I first opted to try Gary Regan’s version of the Godfather which is comprised of 2 parts scotch and 1 part amaretto. This version of the Godfather is still rather sweet, with the sugary almond flavor dominating the palate with only a hint of scotch on the finish. Surprisingly, its nose is not dominated by amaretto the way the flavor is, I guess the aroma of scotch is able to mask the amaretto. I tried to improve this by adding a float of Islay scotch whiskey, which gave it a smoky peaty nose and made the cocktail much more complex. The Islay scotch is also able to help moderate the sweetness of amaretto and ultimately resulted in a more balanced cocktail for my palate.  
I also tried a more modern interpretation of the Godfather from Sam Ross, which uses bourbon in place of the scotch, dials back on the amaretto to a little less than 4:1, and adds a couple dashes of bitters. This looks a lot like an Old-Fashioned, though with amaretto taking the place of the simple syrup/sugar cube. The nose of this version is a bit reminiscent of an amaretto sour, with the lemon oil from the garnish coming through the background of vanilla and almond notes. I thought this was a well-balanced cocktail, with the sweet almond complementing rather than dominating the vanilla and spice of bourbon. I still got a bit of the lemon oil coming through in the drink as well, which highlighted veins of citrus character in the bourbon. The Angostura bitters help to tie everything together and leave their familiar finish on my palate after sipping. I feel like this version is a lot better suited to the modern palate and definitely worth a try if you happen to have some amaretto. Additionally, since Elijah Craig weighs in at 94 proof, it resulted in a robust and flavorful cocktail even after mixing with the amaretto and being served on ice.  

**Variations**  
There are a couple established variations on the Godfather that should be mentioned, though likely could benefit from some retooling themselves. The Godmother substitutes vodka for the scotch, which sounds like a pretty boring one-note cocktail. The Godson or Goddaughter add 1 oz of cream to the Godfather or Godmother, respectively. These might be a nice change of pace if you’re used to drinking White Russians.  I’ll probably just stick to the retooled Godfather myself though.  

**Cheers!**  
Hopefully many of you will be able to give this simple after-dinner drink a try. I highly recommend doing the modern bourbon version, it is well thought out, balanced, and surprisingly delicious. I look forward to reading your feedback to this cocktail, as well as responding to any questions or suggestions you might have. Though I have most of the remainder of the year planned out, if you’re interested in writing a guest post, do drop me a line, I’m sure I can find a suitable place in the schedule for you to share a particular favorite of your own. Cheers!
