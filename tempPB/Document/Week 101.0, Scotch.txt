**Not Cocktail of the Week #101: Rob Roy**  
With the holiday season in full swing, I first have to express my deep gratitude to /u/53V3N and /u/ChristianGeek for their respective gifts of *The 12 Bottle Bar* and *Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails*. Since I just received them this week and things have been crazy with holiday parties and get-togethers, I haven’t had too much time to dive into them, but so far *12 Bottle Bar* might be my new recommendation over *Joy of Mixology* for first cocktail book to get. This week I wanted to revisit the Rob Roy (with another [serendipitous appearance](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2ofmo7/rob_roy_on_the_rocks/) on /r/cocktails recently thanks to /u/jaba1337), a cocktail that I previously did not particularly enjoy and felt that I hadn’t yet given it its due. It’s a simple cocktail needing only three ingredients, but as with many of the simple classics, one that is open and accessible to experimenting until you find a version you personally enjoy.

**Background**  
The Rob Roy hails from the previous turn of the century, first announced in the *New York Herald* in 1897 as, “the Fifth-Avenue hotel [The Waldorf-Astoria] has two new drinks this winter, the Star cocktail and the Rob Roy cocktail…”, defined as “…made of Scotch whisky…completed by vermouth and orange bitters.”, and credited on old copies of the menu to a certain John “Curley” O’Conner. According to David Wondrich’s *Imbibe* and Bill Grimes’ *Straight Up or On the Rocks*, the Rob Roy gets its name from the Reginald DeKoven comedy musical of the same name that opened around the corner from the Waldorf-Astoria at the Herald Square Theater in 1894. Both the musical and cocktail are named after the titular star, described as a Scottish Robin Hood by Gary Regan, with the supposed inspiration for the cocktail being an attempt to capture the hue of his red hair.  
The Rob Roy became popular not only because it was simple and tasty, but it also appeared at the right time. At the turn of the last century, Americans had a growing fascination with Scottish culture (perhaps akin to the Tiki obsession of the 1950s) vis-à-vis the introduction of golf. While the Scottish still generally enjoy their drams neat, as usual us crazy Americans were mixing it initially in hot toddies and soon after into Rob Roys. This helped launch Scotch whisky in the United States, particularly Dewar’s blended Scotch, which can still be found today. Despite this popularity, mixing cocktails with Scotch was and still remains a challenge. Only a few classic recipes like the [Blood and Sand](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1yds2e/not_cocktail_of_the_week_59_blood_and_sand/) and closely related [Bobby Burns](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/169jv7/cocktail_of_the_week_3_bobby_burns/) are remembered to this day, but hopefully we’ll discover and establish some more modern classics like the [Penicillin](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1ola4b/not_cocktail_of_the_week_41_penicillin/).  

**Recipes**  
*The Savoy Cocktail Book*, Harry Craddock, 1930  
* 1 Dash Angostura Bitters  
* ½ Italian Vermouth  
* ½ Scotch Whisky  
Shake well and strain into cocktail glass.  

*The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*, David Embury, 1948  
* Made exactly like the Manhattan (2:1 Whisky to Vermouth with 1 dash Angostura) but with Scotch in place of the rye or bourbon. If orange bitters are used instead of Angostura, this drink is sometimes called the Highland, or the Highland Fling, or the Express. 

*The Joy of Mixology*, Gary Regan, 2003  
* 2 oz Scotch  
* 1 oz sweet vermouth  
* Peychaud’s bitters to taste (optional)
Stir and strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with a maraschino cherry (or lemon twist).  

*Imbibe!*, David Wondrich, 2007  
via *The Banquet Book*, 1902  
A little stronger than the vermouth is this one, which is made warmer by half a jigger [1.5 oz] of Scotch whisky and the same amount of vermouth (Italian), with lemon peel and two dashes of bitters.  
Notes: While the proportions stated are equal parts, more often these days it is 2:1 and with the lower-proof liquors we get today, Wondrich prefers the latter. He also suggests Regan’s Orange Bitters No. 6 as well as a twist of orange peel.   

*Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails*, Ted Haigh, 2009  
* 2.5 oz Scotch  
* 1 oz sweet vermouth  
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters  
Combine in an iced mixing glass. Stir and strain into a cocktail glass or onto fresh rocks in a rocks glass. Either way, garnish with a cherry.   

*The PDT Cocktail Book*, Jim Meehan, 2011  
via *The Cocktail Book: A Sideboard Manual for Gentlemen*, 1900  
* 2.5 oz Famous Grouse Blended Scotch Whisky  
* 0.75 Dolin Sweet Vermouth  
* 2 dashes Angostura Orange Bitters  
Stir with ice and strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with a lemon twist.   

*Death & Co.*, David Kaplan, 2014  
* 2 oz Compass Box Asyla Scotch  
* 0.75 oz Carpano Antica Formula Vermouth  
* 2 dashes Angostura Bitters

**Results**  
I did my best to try a number of versions of the Rob Roy and find one that suited my palate as previous experience with this cocktail were not too positive. I started off following the instructions of David Wondrich in *Imbibe*, using a 2:1 ratio of Bank Note blended Scotch to Dolin Rouge, 2 dashes of orange bitters, and garnishing with a small expressed orange twist. This version had a very bright and fresh nose of citrus backed by woody Scotch notes. The initial experience was of a light and sweet cocktail with a mild texture, finishing with a touch of smoke. Focusing a bit more, I first got a hint of fruity Dolin Rouge coming through briefly, followed by Scotch in the middle, and finishing with an herbal bitterness and a mild smoke note. While this drink seems to be modeled on the Manhattan, this version seemed very distinct and really highlighted the differences between the heavy wood and spice notes in an assertive rye whiskey and the more delicate smoke and wood notes in Scotch. Ultimately this version does not illustrate the parallel between this and the Manhattan as this was much lighter-bodied and retained much of the Scotch character rather than becoming something new. Still, if you’re looking for a simple and light winter sipper, this might be the direction to go.  
My second version was much more to my taste, using the 2.5:1 ratio I’m more familiar with for my Manhattan and also the one recommended by the recently acquired *Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails* by Ted Haigh. I also elected in this case to go with Angostura bitters as, while David Wondrich is an authority on historic cocktail recipes, the general consensus starting with *The Savoy Cocktail Book* to the modern *Death & Co.* book is to use Angostura. This Rob Roy was definitely more reminiscent of a Manhattan with the spicy notes of Angostura clearly coming through on the nose, accompanied by the woody and mildly smoky notes of Scotch. The increased portion of spirit definitely suited my modernly trained palate as I felt this had a richer and more balanced texture compared to the previous one. I also preferred the Angostura bitters over orange bitters, but that may be my personal bias. In any case, this Rob Roy had a slightly thicker texture on the tongue and a more predictable flavor progression opening with the Scotch, progressing to the herbal fruitiness of Dolin, and finishing with the spice of Angostura and a brief heat from the Scotch. I elected to garnish this version with a cherry, which definitely evoked the classic Manhattan in my mind, though it left me wondering what a Manhattan garnished with an orange twist would be like.  
As a final crazy idea, I did a Rob Roy using an Islay Scotch at a 2:1 ratio with the more assertive Punt e Mes sweet vermouth. While I had originally intended to then pair it with orange bitters, upon getting the smoky nose from Bowmore 12, I decided that Peychaud’s bitters might be a more interesting and suitable pairing, but still garnished with an orange twist for a touch of fruit. In *Joy of Mixology*, Gary Regan says that David Embury suggests using Peychaud’s bitters in his 1948 *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks* and while I couldn’t find mention of this at all when upon double checking, I still thought the idea had some merit in this case. This version of the Rob Roy had a wild aroma primarily of orange citrus and smoke, though I felt there was a faint hint of the herbal bitterness of Punt e Mes coming through. Upon sipping, this was a shocking experience as it was initially very light with just a touch of fruity vermouth, leaving me wondering where all the flavor had gone, but moments later to get bombed by smoke and an unexpected funky note, finishing with a long lingering bitterness and smoke. It was powerful enough to bring to mind a particular scene from [Braveheart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aMKE-Y6oHE#t=95) that I think captures the experience of this version (warning: dying horses).
