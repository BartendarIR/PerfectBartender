**Not Cocktail of the Week #70: Revolver & The Other Left**  
Ever since my last visit to Bourbon and Branch (which was shamefully 3 months ago, oh how time flies), I’ve been meaning to make one of their most well-known and signature cocktails, the Revolver. Since I’ve recently acquired a bottle of coffee liqueur, I can finally put together and share this great cocktail with all of you.

**Background**  
The Revolver is reportedly created in 2003 at Bourbon and Branch and credited to bartender Joe Santer for the launch of Bulleit bourbon. However, as far as I can tell, there may be some incongruence in this story as Bourbon and Branch did not open until 2006 ([yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bourbon-and-branch-san-francisco?start=2200&sort_by=date_desc) and [SF Chronicle](http://www.sfgate.com/wine/article/The-cosmo-free-zone-Bartending-purists-demand-2550326.php)) and Bulleit bourbon was introduced to US markets in 1999 ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulleit#History)). But what’s a few years here or there in the grand scheme of cocktail history? There’s plenty of leeway and no shortage of hazy origin stories for classics. In any case, it is cleverly named after the fact that you put Bulleit (pronounced bullet) in a Revolver. 

**Recipes**  
via /u/AlmightyJ, bartender at Bourbon and Branch, 2014  
* 2 oz Bulleit bourbon

**Results**  
When Justin first made me a Revolver, I recall commenting that it reminded me of a Manhattan, though with a coffee bitterness rather than the spice bitterness of Angostura. In the relative privacy (and sobriety) of my own home, I would have to reconsider this opinion, likening it a bit more to a unique take on an Old-Fashioned. This cocktail starts off with a very appealing nose of orange, warm baking spices, and caramelized sugar from the flamed orange twist, along with a note of coffee hinting at the surprising depth to this drink. Upon sipping, it starts briefly with a distinct coffee note before transitioning to the familiar vanilla and oak profile of bourbon and finishing with a lingering roast-y bitterness of coffee on the finish. I think that St. George NOLA coffee liqueur, which I decided on for my coffee liqueur, is a bit less sweet than Tia Maria (though I can’t confirm that without side-by-side tasting), so I found that adding a dash of simple syrup helped bring this closer to the flavor I remember at Bourbon and Branch. Depending on the coffee liqueur you use, you may find this helps tame the initial coffee note and better balance the drink. 

**The Other Left**  
*Background*  
Inspired by the Revolver and another modern classic, the [Left Hand](http://www.kindredcocktails.com/cocktail/left-hand), I humbly would like to include a rare NCotW original that I call The Other Left in what is usually the **Variations** section. This cocktail is partially inspired out of me lacking enough reasons to pick up some chocolate bitters to make a proper Left Hand and partially because I really love Campari. Depending on your frame of reference, The Other Left is a [Boulevardier](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/180rvd/not_cocktail_of_the_week_5_boulevardier/) with coffee liqueur, or a Left Hand with coffee liqueur instead of chocolate bitters.  

*Recipe*  
* 1.75 oz Bulleit bourbon  
* 0.75 oz Campari  
* 0.5 oz Dolin sweet vermouth  
* 0.25 oz St. George NOLA coffee liqueur  
Stir, strain, garnish with an orange peel

*Results*  
After multiple iterations, I can see this becoming another of my favorites and an original drink that I actually serve to friends. The Other Left starts with a bright citrus nose from the fresh orange twist with some dark coffee notes lurking in the background. I elected not to do a flamed orange twist to garnish as I wanted the fresh notes to complement the Campari. This cocktail has a full-bodied texture due to the significant proportion of liqueurs. Flavor-wise, it is a unique assault on the palate, intensely flavored and a combination that I personally find very enjoyable. It starts with the notes of orange from the nose and a brief hint of the bitterness that to come, then starts to transition into sweet notes for the body from both the Campari and coffee liqueur which smoothly merges into the complementary flavor of bourbon. The finish is long-lasting and is first the roast-y bitterness of coffee and finishes with the dry citrus bitterness of Campari that clings to your palate. If you get some coffee liqueur to make a Revolver, give this a try as well and let me know what you think.

**Cheers!**  
Thanks for reading, hopefully you’ve enjoyed your weekly dose of NCotW. If you’re considering getting a bottle of coffee liqueur to make the Revolver, I’ll do my best to have a few more cocktails on NCotW featuring coffee liqueur so that you can get the most out of your bottle. It’s very rare for me to put together an original cocktail, so I’d love to hear your feedback on The Other Left if you’re willing to give it a shot. Thanks to whoever it was that was generous enough to gift me another month of reddit gold last week, it is much appreciated. Thanks to all my readers for their continued support, hopefully you’re all getting as much out of this as I am. With that, until next week, cheers!
