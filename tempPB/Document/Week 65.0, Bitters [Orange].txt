**Not Cocktail of the Week #65: Bronx & Income Tax**  
While I had originally planned to write about the Gimlet this week and post the Income Tax cocktail next week in ~~commemoration~~ ~~celebration~~ condemnation of Tax Day in the US, the untimely crisis and shortage of limes made that difficult, so the simple and delicious Gimlet will have to wait. Truthfully, I had scheduled a post about the Bronx cocktail a few weeks ago when I was going through cocktails using orange juice, but I really struggled with getting it to my liking. After further consideration and some discussion with /u/AlmightyJ at Bourbon & Branch, we agreed that the Income Tax, a direct descendent of the Bronx, was much more palatable. As a result, this week’s NCotW will go over both cocktails and at the end you can make your own decision.  

**Background**  
The Bronx cocktail is generally credited to a Johnnie Solon, a bartender at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel bar in the 1900s. While a recipe for the Bronx can be found as early as 1908 in William Boothby’s *The World’s Drinks and How to Mix Them*, the origin story is claimed in 1931 by Albert Stevens Crockett, author of *The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book*. However, as with many of these classics, it is impossible to definitively confirm one single story so if you want to know more, check out David Wondrich’s book *Imbibe!*, as he uncovers some more details on other potential origins of this cocktail.  
The roots of the Bronx cocktail are in an older cocktail, the Duplex, consisting of equal parts sweet vermouth and dry vermouth, a dash of orange bitters, garnished with an orange twist. When Johnnie Solon was challenged by a customer to improve upon this drink, he replaced the orange bitters with orange juice and stiffened it with a healthy measure of gin. Since Johnnie Solon worked at the Big Brass Rail at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, located where the Empire State Building is today, one may ask why he named this cocktail the Bronx. According to the story from Albert Stevens Crockett:  
> The name? No, it wasn't really named directly after the borough or the river so-called. I had been at the Bronx Zoo a day or two before, and I saw, of course, a lot of beasts I had never known. Customers used to tell me of the strange animals they saw after a lot of mixed drinks. So when Traverson [his server] said to me, as he started to take the drink in to the customer, "What'll I tell him is the name of this drink?" I thought of those animals, and said: "Oh, you can tell him it is a 'Bronx'.  

The Bronx cocktail skyrocketed in popularity, resulting in the bar going through several cases of oranges each day and becoming that era’s drink du jour analogous to the Cosmopolitan cocktail at the end of the 20th century. While nearly forgotten today, in 1934 it was ranked #3 in a list of “The World’s 10 Most Famous Cocktails” by Harman Burney Burke, beaten only by the immortal Martini and Manhattan. The Bronx cocktail’s incredible popularity played a large part in making orange juice acceptable in mainstream cocktails, though from personal experience orange juice still remains a relatively difficult and touchy ingredient to work with.  
The Income Tax, unlike the Bronx cocktail, has no real origin story other than at some point, some enterprising bartender or two must have had the revolutionary (or obvious) idea of adding a dash of Angostura bitters. While the Bronx is much more notable, the addition of bitters for an Income Tax goes a long way in melding the flavors of these ingredients together. Plus the name itself almost guarantees that you’ll remember to have one of these each year.
