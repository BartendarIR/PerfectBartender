**Not Cocktail of the Week #93: The Earl Grey MarTEAni and the Mandala**

This week's NCotW is a Modern Classic created by contemporary legend Audrey Saunders, along with an original twist on the recipe.  I'm /u/ems88, filling in for /u/hebug this week.

Saunders is responsible for a fair number of cocktails that have spread far beyond the walls of the bars where they were first shaken or stirred including the [Old Cuban](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/dining/025rrex.html?_r=0), the [Gin Gin Mule](http://nymag.com/listings/recipe/gin-gin-mule/), and [Not Cocktail of the Week #19: Intro to Aperol](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1eegsr/not_cocktail_of_the_week_19_intro_to_aperol/).

**Background**

The Earl Grey MarTEAni is a tea-infused variation on the classic Gin Sour (with egg white).  It was first developed in 2002 for an event at the Ritz Hotel London.  Saunders continued to offer the MarTEAni as part of her cocktail program at Bemelmans in Manhattan's Carlyle Hotel, and when she opened Pegu Club in 2005 she brought the drink with her.

The drink rose in popularity to become one of Pegu Club's most ordered cocktails, but in 2010 it found itself at the center of a controversy related to use of raw egg whites in bars and was temporarily removed from the menu.  The substantial fines and citations initially threatened were never imposed, and the Earl Grey MarTEAni returned to the menu in triumph.

The cocktail has since taken on a life of its own, appearing on menus from Vancouver to London to Beijing.  In 2013 Difford's Guide included it on their list of the Top 100 Cocktails.  I have seen the MarTEAni served (under a variety of names; sometimes credited, sometimes not) at more bars than almost any other drink developed since the Cosmopolitan, thus cementing its status as a Modern Classic Cocktail.

**Recipe**

Audrey's Earl Grey MarTEAni

New York Magazine, *The State of the Cocktail*, 2004

* 1 ½ oz Earl Grey tea-infused Tanqueray gin

* 1 oz simple syrup (1:1 ratio)

* ¾ oz fresh lemon juice

* 1 egg white

Measure all the ingredients into a mixing glass.  Add ice, and shake hard to a 10-second count.  Strain into a chilled martini glass, ½ rimmed with sugar, and garnish with a lemon twist.

For the Earl Grey-infused gin:

* 1 750 ml bottle of Tanqueray gin

* 4 tablespoons of loose Earl Grey tea

Measure tea into bottle.  Cap and shake, and let sit at room temperature for 2 hours.  Strain through a fine sieve or coffee filter into a bowl.  Rinse out bottle to remove loose tea, and pour infusion back into clean bottle.

**Technique**

While not addressed in the New York Magazine recipe, [for drinks incorporating egg whites there are a few techniques to help achieve an optimal texture](http://imgur.com/a/BDdFG/).  Once the ingredients are assembled in the shaker tin, a 10 second “dry shake” without ice will help with the emulsification of the egg white.  In addition, adding the coil of a Hawthorne strainer during the dry shake will provide additional agitation.  Remove the coil, add ice and shake vigorously for 15 seconds.  Finally, it is especially important with egg white drinks to “double strain” with both a Hawthorne strainer and a fine mesh strainer.

**Results**

[I've played around with a few different gins as the base for this infusion](http://imgur.com/Dy9UH2X).  I did these in small batches, using 1½ teaspoons of tea for 3 oz of gin (which is also a good way to make this cocktail at home if you don't want to commit to infusing a full bottle of gin).  As the initial recipe called for Tanqueray (a London Dry Gin), I decided to compare it with Venus Spirits Gin (a New Western Dry Gin from Santa Cruz featuring citrus and lavender) and No. 209 (a Bergamot orange-forward gin from San Francisco).    

The Tanqueray version I treated as a baseline, for which it served quite well.  The juniper-forward notes play well with the drying tannins of the tea, but beyond that no distinct botanicals stood out.  By comparison, the Venus Spirits Gin brought floral notes to the table making the resulting profile reminiscent of a cup of Lady Grey tea.  Finally, the Bergamot elements of the No. 209 accentuated the Bergamot of the Earl Grey to create a veritable orange bomb which, while not entirely unpleasant, had a few rough edges and lacked the balance of the other two.

While the original recipe calls for a sugar rim, I prefer my Earl Grey MarTEAni without.  As is shown in the picture, I also opted to garnish with a lemon wedge instead of the lemon peel called for in the original recipe.  I did this because the overall profile is more likely to be found a touch sweet than a touch sour, so the option to add a squeeze of lemon seemed like a good way to provide the ability for the drinker to modify the cocktail to their palate.

As with other egg white drinks all three versions had a luscious, creamy texture.  In each case the tannins of the tea created a drying sensation which brought an unusual element to the cocktail's balance.  The dryness added depth to the sour and sweet profile of the Gin Sour base.

This cocktail serves well as an introduction for people skeptical of egg whites as an ingredient.  The flavors expressed in the Earl Grey MarTEAni are familiar, but the format in which they are presented is entirely novel, allowing the drink to be at once both provocative and simultaneously comforting.

**The Mandala**

The frothy, creamy texture of the Earl Grey MarTEAni reminds me of a cappuccino.  This inspired me to create a chai-driven twist on the cocktail for the menu at 515 Kitchen & Cocktails in Santa Cruz, CA.  The name is a reference to the Sand Mandalas of Tibetan Buddhism: intricate works of symbolic art created over the course of days and destroyed upon their completion as a meditation on impermanence.  An ephemeral work of art that is crafted with the intention of being destroyed reminds me of some of the elements of cocktails that I most enjoy.

**Recipe**

* 2 oz chai tea-infused gin

* 1 oz simple syrup (1:1 ratio)

* ½ oz fresh lemon juice

* 1 dash cardamom bitters (Scrappy's)

* 1 egg white

* Angostura bitters (for garnish)

Follow the process described above for egg white drinks, omitting the Angostura bitters from the shaker and instead using them to decorate the surface of the cocktail.

For the chai tea-infused gin:

* 1 liter London Dry Gin

* 4 tablespoons of loose chai tea blend

Decant gin into a non-reactive container and add tea.   Allow to infuse for 3 hours (I find the longer infusion time lends itself to a better extraction of the dry spices in the chai tea blend), stirring occasionally, then strain using a coffee filter or a fine mesh sieve and return to the bottle.  For a smaller infusion use 1½ teaspoons of chai tea for every 4 oz of gin.

**Three Ways to Decorate the Top of an Egg White Cocktail with Bitters**

(Click on the links for demonstrative gifs)

[First Method](http://imgur.com/2oVOoI4): Using an Angostura bitters-filled atomizer, spray a stripe down the middle of the cocktail.  Using a straw, in a continuous motion draw a switchback of lines perpendicular to the stripe starting at one end.  Upon reaching the other end, stop the switchback in the middle of the stripe and draw the straw along the center of the stripe back to its base.  This creates a rosetta pattern.

[Second Method](http://imgur.com/PbkcMtq): Using a dropper (or a straw in conjunction with a bitters-filled shot glass), create a spiral of dots starting in the center of the cocktail and expanding outwards.  Using a straw, trace the path of the spiral.  This creates a spiral of leaves.

[Third Method](http://imgur.com/yLik0vs): Using the Angostura dasher bottle, dash parallel lines across the top of the cocktail.  Using a straw, cut across the lines of bitters in alternating directions in individual strokes.  This creates a herringbone-like set of parallel zig zags.
