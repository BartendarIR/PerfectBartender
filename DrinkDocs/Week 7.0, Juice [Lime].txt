**Not Cocktail of the Week #7: Lion’s Tail**  
I’m glad that I have this weekly column to write about my home cocktail experiences as it has spurred me to finally finish making my homemade allspice liqueur, aka pimento dram. My intent when making my allspice liqueur was to use it in cocktails around Christmas time as the spicy allspice and cinnamon flavors seem to fit the season, but I just never actually got around to it.  
Instead I figured that it would be clever to feature it for Chinese New Year, which kicked off February 10th, and is traditionally is celebrated for up to 15 days following. Given the traditional lion dance associated with Chinese New Year festivities, the Lion’s Tail cocktail seemed like an well-named cocktail for this week.  

**Background**  
The Lion’s Tail originates from the 1930s, first documented in the very rare Café Royal Cocktail Book compiled by William J. Tarling and published in 1937. It has remained in relative obscurity until more recently when it was published in Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails by Ted Haigh. In any case, it is a very unique cocktail, featuring pimento dram aka allspice liqueur, which I will discuss in more depth below. The name of this cocktail likely stems from a reference to “twisting the Lion’s tail”, serving as a warning during the era of British colonialism to avoid causing trouble lest the Lion (Britain) come roaring down on you. The combination of ingredients from former British colonies such as Jamaica (rum/lime/allspice) and America (bourbon whiskey), might be a playful jab befitting this cocktails name.  

**Recipe**  
* 2 oz bourbon  
* 0.5 oz allspice dram  
* 0.5 oz fresh lime juice  
* 1 dash Angostura bitters  
* 0.25-0.5 oz 1:1 simple syrup to taste  
Shaken on ice, no garnish  

My best recipe using homemade allspice dram (your results may vary)  
* 2.5 oz Elijah Craig 12  
* 0.5 oz allspice dram  
* 0.75 oz lime juice  
* 0.5 oz simple syrup 1:1  
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters  
Shaken on ice, no garnish

Note: similar to my recipe for a Manhattan, this is probably closer to having two normal cocktails since I appreciate a generous pour and this was the best tasting version I managed. You have been warned.

**Results**  
This is a very interesting cocktail, but you may find your results will vary depending on how sweet your pimento dram is. I do not own a bottle of St. Elizabeth pimento dram, so I unfortunately cannot comment on how that compares to my homemade version. The combination of bourbon and lime is generally rare, but given that the base of pimento dram is white rum, it somehow manages to pull the flavors together. This cocktail is at first very clearly a sour, the lime being the first flavor to hit your mouth. Bourbon provides a strong backbone to carry the cocktail into its unique bitter and spicy flavor comprised of the Angostura bitters mixing with the additional allspice and potentially cinnamon of the pimento dram. Ultimately I experience a rather lingering finish reminiscent of the flavors you have after sipping on some hot apple cider or mulled wine.  

**Pimento Dram and DIY**  
Pimento dram is a liqueur made by infusing white rum with allspice berries and is most commonly featured in tropical tiki style drinks. Allspice is the dried unripe fruit of the Pimenta dioica tree, native to the Caribbean region and one of the most important flavors in cuisine from that region. Natively known as pimenta, English colonists decided to call it allspice as its flavor reminded them of a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. Perhaps in respect to its origins, allspice liqueur is commonly referred to as pimento dram, though it runs the risk of being confused with the pimento cherry pepper used in pimento stuffed olives. Perhaps we should start referring to it as pimenta dram instead?  
As I mentioned in the beginning of this article, I thought it would be fun to make my own pimento dram. There are a couple recipes that are floating around the internet, [this](http://www.kaiserpenguin.com/pimento-dram/) one by Kaiser Penguin to be well regarded, but I went with this [post]( http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/02/diy-allspice-dram-make-your-own-st-elizabeths-pimento-dram-recipe.html) from Serious Drinks as it was my original introduction to this ingredient and served as my inspiration to making it.  The Serious Drinks recipe makes about 3 cups of pimento dram, which seemed excessive to me, so I scaled it down and my recipe for a smaller volume, approx. 4 oz total, is below:  
* 4 oz light rum (I used Flor de Cana Extra Dry, but traditionally should be Wray & Nephew)  
* 2 tbsp whole allspice berries  
* 1/4 cinnamon stick  
Crush allspice berries (I didn’t have a mortar and pestle but found that my mixing glass and muddler were more than up to the task) and infuse in the rum for 4 days shaking it once daily. On day 5, crush up the cinnamon stick and add to your infusion before letting it sit for 7 additional days still shaking it once daily. After a total time of 12 days, strain out all the solids using a mesh strainer, then follow it up by straining it through a coffee filter. At this point, I found that a significant amount of the original rum basically was soaked up in the allspice berries so despite starting with 4 oz of rum, my final infused product was only approximately 2 oz. I also ended up halting my project at this point for about 2 months, which may help mellow out the flavors, but I did finish it earlier this month by adding an equal volume of brown sugar syrup, made by dissolving an equal volume of brown sugar in water. I ended up with a small jar of pimento dram, which is very strongly spiced and not really something I would have alone. At some point I will hopefully have a chance to encounter a bottle of the more commonly used St. Elizabeth or Wray & Nephew pimento dram, which I imagine are sweeter than my attempt. 

**Cheers!**  
If you have a bottle of pimento dram, shake up this cocktail and enjoy. For everybody else, consider making your own pimento dram, it is really rather simple and is worth giving a shot. I know this ingredient is definitely not found in most home bars, so next week’s post will be something simpler. Hope you enjoyed this week’s column, let me know how your Lion’s Tail went or your favorite cocktails using pimento dram in the comments below.
