**Not Cocktail of the Week #105: Old Pal**  
So for the first time in the two years that NCotW has been going, I finally skipped a week and it was glorious. I hope everybody had a great Christmas and New Year’s, I had a chance to head back to Seattle for a week and had a blast. For this post, I wanted to share the Old Pal cocktail, as I haven’t introduced a new Campari cocktail recently and this one is a classic that many people love. 

**Background**  
The Old Pal cocktail is first found in the epilogue of Harry MacElhone’s *Barflies and Cocktails* from 1927 and later in his 1929 reprint of *Harry’s ABCs of Mixing Cocktails*. While he may not as well-known as Jerry Thomas and his books not as popular as others such as *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, Harry MacElhone left the Plaza Hotel in New York during Prohibition and set up shop in Paris, serving as head bartender and owner of Harry’s New York Bar in Paris from 1923 until his death in 1958. His books predate *The Savoy Cocktail Book* and are responsible for introducing a great number of popular drinks such as the [Sidecar](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/19cmfw/not_cocktail_of_the_week_8_sidecar/), [Boulevardier](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/180rvd/not_cocktail_of_the_week_5_boulevardier/), [Scofflaw](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1r389k/not_cocktail_of_the_week_46_scofflaw/), and more. In *Barflies and Cocktails*, Arthur Moss, a friend of Harry MacElhone, credits the Old Pal to a conversation from 1878 with an old pal of his, the sports writer “Sparrow” Robertson. Oddly though, the original reference from 1927 states the recipe as “1/3 Canadian Club, 1/3 Eyetalian Vermouth, and 1/3 Campari”, bringing it very close in line with the previously mentioned Boulevardier or a Negroni, but a mere two years later it was formalized as using dry vermouth. Regardless, the dry vermouth version is what became standard and has persisted in this form until today.

**Results**  
I tried two versions of the Old Pal, starting first with the more modern spirit-forward recipe from Death & Co. (and others) following their recommendation of Rittenhouse rye. This version started with a well-balanced nose with aromatic lemon and bright citrus notes from the garnish, a candied spice note from the rye, and some mild herbal notes probably from the vermouth. Upon tasting, it initially surprised me with a deceptively mild flavor and light texture, though it quickly shifts to the expected bitter flavor and heavy texture. It started with light lemon and herbal vermouth up front, which gave way to a brief and short spice note quickly bullied to the side by Campari. Somehow the peppery and spicy rye made the bitterness of Campari much more prominent at this ratio with a surprisingly intense woody and grapefruity bitterness on the finish. Alternatively, Campari’s bitterness may appear stronger without the flavors of its familiar partner, sweet vermouth, balancing it out. While this version may be the new standard, despite my love for Campari, I didn’t really fall in love with it and would consider this a relatively challenging cocktail.  
I also tried the more classic Old Pal recipe which calls for equal parts of each, akin to my preferred Negroni recipe, and unexpectedly found it more palatable. For this version, I used Bulleit rye, which is less aggressively spicy, but retains a lot of woody flavor. The nose of this version was less interesting than the last, comprised primarily of lemon oil with a hint of some woody herbal notes. Texturally, this was familiar territory with a moderately thick mouthfeel from the Campari, again evoking the Negroni in my mind. Flavor-wise, this started with a mild spice from the rye, followed by the fruity vermouth in the body, and finishing with the strong sweet bitterness of Campari. While this version has a larger proportion of Campari than the spirit-forward one, it actually tasted less bitter to me, either because of the additional matching portion of vermouth or the decreased final proof of the cocktail. Ultimately, I prefer this version and given my propensity for Negronis, Boulevardiers and the like, I can see adding this to my rotation of Campari drinks.  

**Cheers!**  
Hope you all continue to enjoy the occasional NCotW post, it still serves as great motivation for me to dig a little deeper into learning about cocktails and a good outlet for passing along what I learn to the betterment of the community. It’s always surprising and humbling for me to hear compliments from real bartenders familiar with my little hobby and to receive so many generous gifts from the /r/cocktails community. I hope to grow my readership even further this year, reaching beyond reddit, in hopes of finding more support to fund a book. I’ve naively assumed that word would spread on its own and taken a bit of a passive role in promoting my work, but with so much on the internet and seeing how successful marketing dumb products on kickstarter can be, I hope to be more active with this and see how it turns out this year. Anyways, I’m glad to be back and have the opportunity to continue sharing and look forward to your comments on this week’s cocktail. Cheers!
