**Not Cocktail of the Week #39: Sherry Cobbler**  
Welcome back to your regular NCotW feature on /r/cocktails. Despite being in Vegas for the weekend, I was able to plan ahead and put together this somewhat overdue article on the very classic Sherry Cobbler. Though the weather is cooling and this is probably best enjoyed in the summer, it is still a very pleasant autumn cocktail and will hopefully serve as a good introduction to sherry, an underappreciated ingredient that may finally be getting its due. 

**Background**  
The Sherry Cobbler predates most cocktails as we know them, as they were concocted following the popularity and ubiquity of punch. It is believed to have originated around 1830s and alongside the Mint Julep, played a formative role in popularizing the use of ice to cool drinks. Its name may actually refer to the “cobble” or pebble-sized bits of crushed ice being. It is first documented in the 1862 edition of Jerry Thomas’ seminal work *How to Mix Drinks* and referred to by the Victorian novelist Charles Reade the following year as one of America’s best “mixtures” thusly:  
> America is fertile in mixtures: what do we not owe her? Sherry Cobbler, Gin Sling, Cocktail, Mint Julep, Brandy Smash, Sudden Death, Eye Openers.  

The popularity of the Sherry Cobbler continued for the next couple decades with Harry Johnson writing in his *Bartender’s Manual* that:  
>This drink is without doubt the most popular beverage in the country, with ladies as well as with gentlemen. It is a very refreshing drink for old and young.  

There are many references to the Sherry Cobbler in other periodicals and in literature, which are documented in David Wondrich’s *Imbibe!*, so if you are interested in a little more history, you can read more in the article he wrote on Esquire [here](http://www.esquire.com/drinks/sherry-cobbler-drink-recipe) or additionally in [this article](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/drink/2013/07/sherry_cobbler_a_history_of_the_quintessential_american_beverage.html) from Slate.

**Results**  
This is a change of pace from my usual cocktails, but I’ve come to enjoy the Sherry Cobbler quite a bit. From my first tasting, I first get a pleasant orange nose from the fresh sliced orange garnishing the drink and the lightly muddled orange in the drink itself. Upon sipping (or with this drink perhaps closer to swigging), I first get a mild sweetness from the cane syrup and the tender tartness of orange giving a smooth introduction, then the unique mineral and nutty notes of fino sherry enter the picture contributing to a unique savory finish. I found this drink somewhat odd on its own probably because I’m not accustomed to fino sherry, but I really enjoyed this with food. This notion was strengthened by my second tasting where the Sherry Cobbler really started growing on me as a casual light and refreshing drink to take with food. Additionally, I think I was getting a bit more of the subtle notes as I noted a caramel note in the sherry. Unfortunately I don’t own any appropriate straws (I need to remedy this and buy some short black straws) nor a Lewis bag to make crushed ice. I gave my Sherry Cobbler an extra firm shake to try and compensate though. I’m not sure whether this drink should be shaken or stirred, as it does have the inclusion of a small amount of orange juice and Jerry Thomas states for it to be shaken (though to be fair he does for most cocktails), however shaking it gives a very muddy looking cocktail, so perhaps it would be better stirred on crushed ice with some lightly muddled orange.  

**Variations**  
There are a ton of variations on the Sherry Cobbler, which belongs to the Cobbler family of drinks. They’re generally quite interchangeable, basically utilizing some sort of wine, lightly sweetened and with a bit of orange. These range from the Catawba Cobbler, Claret Cobbler, Hock Cobbler, Sauternes Cobbler, Madeira Cobbler, Port Cobbler, and Champagne Cobbler. Similarly, you can enjoy a Cobbler using liquor in the form of a Brandy Cobbler, Whiskey Cobbler, Gin Cobbler, Applejack Cobbler, or Rum Cobbler, though the use of liquor makes a much stronger drink and less of a “session” cocktail.  

**Sherry**  
With my remaining space, I thought it would be interesting to educate myself and my readers a bit about sherry, an underutilized ingredient. Sherry is made with Palomino grapes, with a couple exceptions, and hails from Andalucia, the southern region of Spain, with its chalky soil and close exposure to the Atlantic Ocean. This terroir makes sherry a unique wine with bright fruit notes and a focused acidity, though these characteristics can vary widely within the family of sherry wines. Sherry is generally classified into two types, fino (dry) and oloroso (sweet).  
The finos are lean with nutty and mineral notes and also include the manzanillas and amontillados. After fermentation, fino sherry is fortified with unaged grape brandy to ~15% alcohol. Part of what makes finos unique are that unlike most wine, they are aged open to air and are protected from oxidation by “flor”, a layer of indigenous yeasts that form on top of the wine which contribute to its unique nutty character.  
Oloroso sherry is much richer and is fortified up to 18% alcohol, which prevents the growth of “flor”. These are much darker in color and also include Pedro Ximenez and Moscatel sherry, which are sweet dessert wines made from special varietals of grape that are dried to concentrate their sugars before fermentation.  
Sherries are fermented in the solera tradition, in which the new sherry is mixed with older sherries and regularly continues to combine with older sherries as it is allowed to age to what is stated on the bottle. The commonly seen cream sherry that is probably the reason people don’t enjoy sherry are sweetened varieties of the lower quality fino (pale cream sherry) or oloroso (cream sherry) sherry, so don’t get or use those. 

**Cheers!**  
Hope you’ve enjoyed this week’s NCotW post, it’s a bit different than usual, but I thought the Sherry Cobbler was such an important drink that was worth learning more about and sharing with the rest of you. If you have the opportunity to get some nice sherry (Lustau is a commonly recommended and budget-friendly brand), give this drink a try and see if it grows on you. I’m still not very well-educated on the topic of sherry, so if you know more about good brands or cocktails utilizing it, I’d love to know more, and sooner rather than later since my bottle of sherry won’t last much longer before it goes off. Otherwise your questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome in the comments. I think I have a guest post planned next week, which will give me another brief respite in which I will vainly attempt to get ahead on my NCotW posts. Cheers!
