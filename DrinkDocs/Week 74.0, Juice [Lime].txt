**Not Cocktail of the Week #74: Chartreuse Swizzle**  
Huge thanks to /u/highbrowalcoholic for amazing post on the Martini last week, it’s an astounding and really impressive piece of work. Hopefully everyone really enjoyed it, I definitely did. It’s a tough act to follow, but NCotW does happen on a weekly basis, so for this week I wanted to share the Chartreuse Swizzle, a modern cocktail using falernum, a new addition to my liquor cabinet as I slowly gather the pieces for some Tiki stuff this summer. 

**Background**  
I first heard of the Chartreuse Swizzle from its actual creator, Marcovaldo Dionysos, when I met him working behind the bar at Smuggler’s Cove. I honestly can’t remember what I had that night (a common theme when I end up there), but I do remember having a great time geeking out and talking cocktails with him for quite some time. I also remember commenting on what I thought was his unusually apt last name, Dionysos, which is the Greek god of wine, but then learning that is surprisingly easy to change your last name. He is obviously very dedicated to his craft. While the proper recipe for the Chartreuse Swizzle is easily found online these days, I still wanted it straight from the source, so I’ve had it saved as a note on my iPhone for quite some time. Since I’m slowly gearing up to start playing with Tiki cocktails this summer, I finally picked up a bottle of falernum, which allowed me to make this drink.  
The Chartreuse Swizzle was originally created by Marco in 2002 for a cocktail competition at Harry Denton’s Starlight Room in San Francisco while working at Clock Bar. Marco now works at Smuggler’s Cove and very recently was nominated for American Bartender of the Year for Tales of the Cocktail 2014. Conveniently well-timed with this post, let’s toast to his continued success with his original cocktail, the Chartreuse Swizzle.

**Recipes**  
via Marcovaldo Dionysos, bartender at Smuggler’s Cove, 2013  
* 1.25 oz green Chartreuse  
* 1 oz pineapple juice  
* 0.75 oz lime juice  
* 0.5 oz velvet falernum  
Combine ingredients in a Collins glass, fill with crushed ice and swizzle until frosted. Alternatively, shake with ice and strain into an ice-filled Collins glass. Garnish with fresh grated nutmeg and a slapped mint sprig. Serve with a straw.

**Results**  
Lacking a Lewis bag, making crushed ice is…laborious and messy with ice shards flying all over the place. Still, if I’m going to make a cocktail, I’ll do everything I can to make it right. Many ice cubes later, I was able to mostly fill a Collins glass and got pretty close to filling it completely by adding the ice shards after shaking.  
This is a really fun cocktail, refreshing and easy to drink, while being complex and not overly sweet. I get fresh herbaceous and vegetal notes in the nose from the slapped mint and chartreuse, and surprisingly little from my grated nutmeg (possibly because I’ve had that nutmeg sitting out too long). All of the ice makes this drink extremely cold and refreshing when sipping through the straw, with the herbal and complex flavor of Chartreuse up front, tempered by the sweet fruity notes of pineapple and the crisp tart notes of lime. I’m not really familiar with the flavor of falernum, so I had a hard time picking it out as its contribution seems rather subtle. I think I got a bit of the clove spice on the finish that may have been brought forward by the nutmeg finally making an impression on me, but I am unsure. It’s a shame this drink is so delicious because I can definitely see myself blowing through the relatively expensive bottle of green Chartreuse pretty fast making these. Also, while I have to resort to using canned pineapple juice, with the popularity of juicers these days, if you have the means to make fresh pineapple juice, I hear it works wonders in this drink. 

**Variations**  
Something I want to try next is the Improved Chartreuse Swizzle, which adds a bit of Wray and Nephew overproof rum and can be found from Kaiser Penguin [here](http://www.kaiserpenguin.com/improved-chartreuse-swizzle/).

**Falernum**  
I suppose this is a good a time as any to learn about and discuss my new ingredient, falernum. Falernum is either a sweet liqueur or syrup, depending on whether it is alcoholic or non-alcoholic, most commonly flavored with almonds, cloves, ginger, and lime zest. Falernum is used mostly in tropical Tiki style cocktails such as the [Zombie](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1o2ybi/not_cocktail_of_the_week_40_the_zombie/) and Corn n’ Oil. Making your own falernum can be surprisingly simple, with the most barebones [recipe from Serious Eats](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/02/homemade-falernum-for-tiki-drinks-almond-clove-lime-syrup-recipe.html) needing only for almonds, cloves, limes, and rum. From there, you most commonly find the addition of ginger, nutmeg, and allspice as seen in the [recipe from Kaiser Penguin](http://www.kaiserpenguin.com/make-your-own-falernum/), a substitution of anise for nutmeg in the [recipe from Imbibe Magazine](http://imbibemagazine.com/Homemade-Falernum-Recipe), and occasionally the addition of some fresh lime juice in this [recipe from Paul Clarke via CHOW](http://www.chow.com/recipes/28427-paul-clarkes-falernum-9). I ultimately elected to buy falernum because not knowing how much I’d go through, the introduction of lime zest/juice will eventually result in spoilage, but if you have the means and are able to go through the volume, I’d love to hear about your experiences making and using homemade falernum. 

**Cheers!**  
Hope you’ve enjoyed this week’s NCotW, the Chartreuse Swizzle is a fun drink to prepare as the warm months of summer set in. If you have falernum and Chartreuse, you owe it to yourself to make one. I’d love to hear from people more experience with falernum as to how homemade might compare to either the liqueur or syrups in stores. Other than that, as a final note, I’m looking for someone with some graphic design experience for a new project, so hit me up for details if you think you can help. With that, I’ll see you all here again next week. Cheers!
