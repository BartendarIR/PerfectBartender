**Not Cocktail of the Week #42: Delmonico**  
It’s always fun to stumble upon surprisingly interesting and delicious cocktails, especially when they turn out to have a surprising amount of history behind them. The Delmonico is a recent discovery, a simple and classic cocktail that is especially fine to sip on before a meal. 

**Background**  
The Delmonico cocktail is a cocktail named after America’s first real restaurant, Delmonico’s. The first Delmonico’s was opened in 1831 and aimed to cater to those who enjoyed the fancy restaurants of Paris by serving high quality food and drink along with impeccable service. A truly opulent restaurant, their menu at one point ran over 100 pages and many an American classic was invented there. Eggs Benedict, with its soft-cooked eggs and Hollandaise sauce, as well as the Baked Alaska dessert, were both believed to originated from Delmonico’s. Unfortunately, after Prohibition was enacted, the original Delmonico’s restaurants were closed in 1923 as their profits sagged. Since then, the name and legacy have been used in a number of restaurants most of which have already closed, though there is currently a Delmonico’s in New York City. Whether they serve this cocktail is difficult to ascertain as they seem to have failed to renew their online domain. If you’re interested in learning more about Delmonico’s restaurant, check out the 12 Bottle Bar article in the links section, it’s a pretty interesting read.  
  
Cocktail historian David Wondrich dates the Delmonico cocktail to somewhere around 1876, as it uses both sweet and dry vermouth, which did not make its way to the United States until around that time. As its earliest publication was in Boothby’s *American Bar-Tender* in 1891, this story seems probable.  

**Recipes**  
*The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*, David Embury, 1948  
This is a plain *Manhattan* with cognac substituted for the whiskey. If orange bitters are used instead of Angostura, it becomes a *Harvard*. This is also sometimes called a *Saratoga*. The real *Saratoga*, however, is made with apple brandy. There is also a *Delmonico Special* which is merely a *Medium Martini* with 1 teaspoonful of brandy to each drink and a twist of orange peel. [The Delmonico in this post is what he refers to as the *Delmonico Special* so I have included the recipe for a *Medium Martini* with the addition of brandy]  
* 2 to 4 parts gin [2 oz]  
* 1 part French vermouth [0.5-1.0 oz]  
* 1 part Italian vermouth [0.5-1.0 oz]  
* 1 tsp brandy  
* 1 dash orange bitters  
* 1 dash Angostura bitters  
Stir well in a bar glass or Martini pitcher with large cubes of ice and pour into chilled cocktail glasses. Twist lemon peel over the top.

* 1 oz gin  
* 1 oz cognac  
* 0.5 oz dry vermouth  
* 0.5 oz sweet vermouth  
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters  
Add all ingredients to chilled Boston glass, add cracked ice and stir for approximately 25-30 seconds, strain into chilled glass.

**Results**  
I did a couple versions of the Delmonico as I couldn’t find out too much as to the proper character for this drink. I first used the ingredients in my pictures, which are more assertive and intense. Organic Nation is a very clean and delicious juniper-forward gin and Carpano Antica is well-known for its big flavors of vanilla, orange, and bitter botanicals. It was a surprisingly balanced cocktail despite the apparently disparate ingredients. I’ve never had a cocktail using cognac with gin, but the idea of using another base spirit to accentuate is really interesting to me. The nose was of orange oil combined with the inherent orange notes of Carpano Antica and fruitiness of cognac. Using the relatively thick and sweet Carpano Antica also gave it a very smooth mouthfeel. I would describe the flavor of the Delmonico as a whole as juicy and well-blended, I found it challenging to pick out the individual notes but it starts off more fruity before transitioning to a combination of the herbal sweetness of Carpano Antica and the unique flavors I associate with cognac. Its finish is the stiff backbone from the gin and the bitter herbs from the Angostura.  
The second version I had, I went with much subtler and refined ingredients, instead of a juniper-forward gin, I went with Tanqueray Malacca with its soft citrus and spice character, instead of Carpano Antica, I went with the refreshing and fruity Dolin Rouge, and instead of Remy Martin VSOP, I used the dregs of a bottle of some Daniel Bouju Grand Champagne Fines Saveur cognac, an exceptional “VSOP” that I got from David Driscoll at the end of the recent brandy party hosted by K&L Wines at Bar Agricole in San Francisco. I also changed up the bitters, using a dash of orange bitters and a dash of Abbott’s bitters, an old and recently revived style of bitters, that I graciously received from /u/bitcheslovebanjos. I still haven’t gotten around to doing something more in-depth on them, but I find they add a unique sweet anise profile to a drink, akin to an absinthe rinse, but with more subtlety. While this version was significantly different, the overall flavor profile was similar. It starts off very light and fruity, I almost wasn’t sure I was still drinking a cocktail, but then you do still finish with the distinctive gin and herbal notes on the finish, though I found this one a lot drier. I think my Results sections are getting rather long, I’m starting to think of doing them in haiku fashion every once and a while.

**Variations**  
Though I am currently out of Lillet, I think Lillet might hold up very well in place of the dry vermouth in this cocktail, especially with its orange notes. The basic recipe for this cocktail hides a lot of potential subtle variation because I think it would come out very differently with different styles of gin, different profiles of cognac, different characters of vermouth, and different types of bitters. Additionally, I think the idea of accentuating a cocktail with a second spirit as something that merits further exploration and could give us a lot of interesting cocktails like the many variations on a Last Word, but I will have to leave that up to real bartenders with the means and the more experience palates.

As an aside, the Daniel Bouju Grande Champagne Fines Saveur cognac is an amazing deal, it’s super flavorful and fruity while still remaining in the realm of affordable for cocktail purposes. It’s a K&L exclusive, but you can order it [here](http://www.klwines.com/detail.asp?sku=1141382), read its introduction on David’s blog [here](http://spiritsjournal.klwines.com/klwinescom-spirits-blog/2013/9/25/introducing-the-new-bouju-kl-exclusive-cognac.html), and read about part of their journey to France to pick out undiscovered but exceptional cognac and armagnacs [here](http://spiritsjournal.klwines.com/klwinescom-spirits-blog/2013/3/29/france-2013-day-2-cognac-to-armagnac.html).
