**Not Cocktail of the Week #41: Penicillin**  
I really have to give props to last week’s [NCotW guest post on the Zombie](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1o2ybi/not_cocktail_of_the_week_40_the_zombie/) by /u/bitcheslovebanjos, it was very well-researched and extensively tested, certainly at some cost to his liver. I return to you this week to share the Penicillin, a modern cocktail that has become relatively famous and special for utilizing not just Scotch whiskey, a challenging and underappreciated cocktail spirit on its own, but Islay Scotch. 	

**Background**  
The Pencillin cocktail was created in 2005 by the famed bartender Sam Ross at the original Milk + Honey in New York City. This modern cocktail is undoubtedly his invention and has established itself as a modern classic that should withstand the test of time. He shares that his inspiration for the Penicillin came from wanting to challenge the status quo and make a Scotch-based cocktail when Milk + Honey received a shipment of Compass Box whiskies, which are a very well-regarded brand of blended Scotch whiskies that showcase the distinct styles and unique characteristics of Scotch. Scotch whiskey, single malts especially, have generally been considered something that should only be enjoyed neat and not an ingredient in cocktails. In response, Sam Ross created the Penicillin, which goes so far as to utilize Islay whiskey, an especially difficult cocktail ingredient due to its strong peat and smoke flavor. The fact that he successfully married two different styles of Scotch into a delicious cocktail was a notable achievement and catapulted this cocktail “cure-all” into the spotlight.  
Originally hailing from Australia, Sam Ross has been very influential in the American craft cocktail revival, first working with Sasha Petraske to open Little Branch and East Side Company Bar while simultaneously spending a year bartending with Audrey Saunders at Pegu Club in 2004. In his time bartending at Milk + Honey, he has received multiple nominations for Tales of the Cocktail’s Global Bartender of the Year and American Bartender of the Year, eventually winning the latter in 2011. Recently he has returned to the original Milk + Honey space, owning and opening his own bar there which he has called Attaboy. He is also the curator behind the Bartender’s Choice app that I regularly use for inspiration and to find new cocktails. 

**Recipes**  
*Bartender’s Choice* [app](http://bartenderschoiceapp.com/wordpress/), created by Sam Ross and the bartenders at Milk + Honey in NYC, 2012

* 0.375 oz sweetened ginger juice (4 parts ginger juice to 3 parts granulated cane sugar)  
Shaken on ice, fine strained. Float 0.25 oz Islay whiskey and garnish with a slice of candied ginger if available, substitute with fresh ginger if not.

**Results**  
Most recipes that you will find for the Penicillin online call for a honey-ginger syrup usually prepared on the stove, or in some cases just fresh muddled ginger. Sam Ross has shared the exact recipe for the Penicillin, which uses honey syrup and a sweetened ginger juice separately. He explains that the use of raw fresh ginger juice with the sugar directly mixed will have more spark and better capture the spicy ginger character than cooked ginger diluted in simple syrup. So as I always attempt to make the most authentic cocktail as possible, I set about juicing some ginger. Unfortunately I don’t have a juicer, so I figured I would just use some elbow grease and juice it by using a Microplane similar to how I juiced the celery for the [Southern Exposure cocktail](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1jfrqi/not_cocktail_of_the_week_30_southside_and/). I concluded from this exercise that, unsurprisingly, ginger is a lot tougher and yields a lot less juice. It took about 20 minutes for me to shred a thumb-sized knob of ginger, yielding ~0.5 oz of juice. If I ever need to make these for more than myself, I’d definitely at least use a food processor to pulverize the ginger and then strain it to extract the juice.  
I did find my labor to be well-rewarded in this cocktail though; I can definitely see why the Penicillin became so popular. Its nose is simply amazing, which is to be expected with the float of Islay whiskey on top. The smoky and woody notes combine with the floral honey and lemon notes coalescing into an image of having a bit of lemon tart at a campfire on the beach. In the mouth it is complex and sweet with a velvety texture. The ingredients manage to blend together remarkably well, though at the very least it clearly has a body of Scotch. The most notable point was immediately after swallowing in which I first felt a slight lemon tang followed by a surprisingly spicy ginger note. I think I should have skinned the ginger before juicing, as it also came with a woody bitterness that I suspect came from the unskinned ginger. After the spicy spark of ginger fades, it finishes with the unique characteristics of Islay whiskey, as I taste the smokiness, as well as burnt sugar, coffee and some additional citrus notes. If you enjoy Islay whiskey, you owe it to yourself to give this a complex cocktail a try.  

**Islay whiskey**  
Islay whiskey is a unique style of Scotch whiskey produced on Islay, an island off the west coast of Scotland. Islays are unique because they use peat, a bog soil comprised of decomposing vegetation, in the process of drying the barley for their Scotch, giving the final product its unique smoky character. Getting into Islay whiskey can be challenging, especially because you are unlikely to have encountered these flavors anywhere else. It can come across as medicinal (which I ascribe to the smell of band-aids), salty, or oily. I definitely was caught off guard when my first taste of Islay whiskey was a pour of Laphroaig, generally considered to be the strongest Islay whiskey. It tasted to me of liquid smoke and its taste unpleasantly persisted in my mouth the rest of the evening. I don’t think my palate has evolved enough to fully appreciate the stronger Islay whiskies yet, but as with many great things, it may be an acquired taste. There are only a handful of Islay whiskey distilleries which each have their own distinct house style. Laphroiag and Ardbeg are the most strongly peated Islay whiskies, apparently with very distinct peat profiles, not that I would be able to tell the difference. Caol Ila and Lagavulin are also strongly peated, though not to the extent of the first two. I personally elected to get Bowmore, a moderately peated Islay, as it is described as having the unique peaty nose but isn’t too smoky and remains well-balanced in the mouth, which seemed ideal for cocktails. Finally, Bruichladdich and Bunnahabhain are the least peaty of the bunch which might make them ideal for an introduction to Islay whiskey. 

**Cheers!**  
Thanks to all for your continued support of the NCotW column, I’m glad I finally picked up an Islay whiskey so that I could taste and share this modern classic with the rest of you. As usual, your questions, comments, suggestions, and feedback are all welcome in the comments. If you have a favorite cocktail of your own that you’d like to share, feel free to send me a message and don’t be intimidated by last week’s contribution, which really went above and beyond. Hopefully a few of you will be able to give the Penicillin a try yourself, whether in your home bar or at a nice cocktail bar. Until next week, cheers!
