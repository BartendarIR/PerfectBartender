**Not Cocktail of the Week #47: Vasco de Gama**  
Despite Thanksgiving being one of the most American of holidays and cocktails being one of the most original American inventions, somehow there are no particular cocktails well-associated with Thanksgiving. For this day before Thanksgiving, I wanted to share the Vasco de Gama, a modern cocktail that I’ve enjoyed at the Alembic whose flavors seem especially well-suited for the season, and my own variation on it, which I call the Afonso de Albuquerque. 

**Background**  
The Vasco de Gama cocktail was concocted by Danny Louie at The Alembic, one of my favorite cocktail bars in San Francisco. It is named after the famous explorer [Vasco de Gama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama), the first European to reach India by sea, as its flavors are accentuated by a syrup infused with garam masala, a common blend of spices used in Indian cuisine. The warm and exotic spice profile comebine with the familiar flavor of bourbon whiskey and are accentuated with some smoky Islay whiskey, resulting in a cocktail especially well-suited for sipping in the fall.  
I had initially intended on recreating this cocktail at home, but we don’t cook Indian food at home, so I did not have the spices for garam masala on hand. However, since I had just made a spiced rich syrup for use in my [Freestyle Fall Punch](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1rbn5a/freestyle_fall_punch/), I figured I could use it to make a variation on the Vasco de Gama. I named my variation the [Afonso de Albuquerque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afonso_de_Albuquerque), after the famed Portuguese general who followed in Vasco de Gama’s footsteps, conquering Malacca and the “spice islands” which served as the original source of cloves and nutmeg. As these spices are a significant component in the spiced rich syrup I used in my variation, naming it after the military genius who secured Portugal’s hold on the spice trade seemed clever and fitting, while also drawing from the original inspiration for the Vasco de Gama.

Though it has been a while since I last had the chance to enjoy a Vasco de Gama at The Alembic, from what I can recall, it is a well-balanced cocktail that starts out distinctly American in its flavor profile consisting of bourbon and apple, but then take a twist into the exotic with the toasty garam masala spices and smoke of Islay whiskey. Much like the [Penicillin](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1ola4b/not_cocktail_of_the_week_41_penicillin/), it is able to leverage and utilize the challenging flavor of Islay whiskey very well.   
It took me a handful of attempts to come up with a variation on the Vasco de Gama that I found palatable and worth sharing, though I’m certain it could still benefit from additional tweaking. The spices I used in the syrup were chosen primarily because they are flavors that are often associated with the holidays, whether in drinks like hot apple cider and mulled wine, or in desserts like pumpkin pie. Given the spices in my spiced rich syrup, I chose Bulleit rye whiskey as the base instead of bourbon because I felt the cinnamon and nutmeg notes in its nose would intensify and complement those same components in the spiced rich syrup. I don’t have any other Islay whiskey to try using in this drink, perhaps I could have used less if I had one with a stronger smoke character, so if you are using one of those, I would perhaps back off from 0.5 oz to 0.25 oz. In any case, the Afonso de Albuquerque starts with orange and spice on the nose, a comforting blend that smells like the holidays to me. Upon sipping, it has a full-bodied texture, starting first with the spicy profile of rye whiskey, then briefly transitions to the spice and sweetness of the spiced rich syrup before expanding to its full complement of spices combining with the smokiness of Islay whiskey. I initially tried to do a float of Islay, like the Penicillin, but it somehow ended up subdued and seemed to confuse things. Later I stirred it with everything else like the Vasco de Gama and it ended up much more palatable. I enjoy that somehow these flavors meld together yet maintain a distinct profile in the finished product. 

**Cheers!**  
I know a couple of you were inspired to make some of that Freestyle Fall Punch and would already have the syrup on hand to take a crack at my variation on the Vasco de Gama. For the rest of you, I encourage trying to make either the garam masala syrup for the Vasco de Gama, or my spiced rich syrup for the Afonso de Albuquerque. Hopefully I can get some feedback on how you enjoyed either of these cocktails in the comments, but also feel free to leave any questions or feedback below as well. Happy Thanksgiving to all my American readers, I hope you all have a chance to share some good food and drinks with your family and friends. Cheers!
