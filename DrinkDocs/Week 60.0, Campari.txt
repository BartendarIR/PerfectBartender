**Not Cocktail of the Week #60: Aperitif**  
For this week’s installment of NCotW, I wanted to visit a modern cocktail that I stumbled upon thanks to Gary ‘gaz’ Regan’s regular email newsletter ( sign up for it [here](http://www.gazregan.com/)). He regularly features cocktails from bartender submissions that he deems worthy as one of “101 Best New Cocktails”. In any case, I came across the Aperitif a couple months ago and it sounded too delicious to ignore, so I gave it a shot and found it worthy of sharing with the rest of you. Enjoy!

**Background**  
As a recent concoction, there is not too much background to the generically named Aperitif cocktail. It was submitted to Gary Regan by Joy Napolitano at Elle Restaurant in Rome, Italy. In her own words, 
>“This drink was created for the Campari bartender competition in Italy. The mix of ingredients is really delicious. The Campari is the main element and the other ingredients exalts its flavor.  The co2 will give us the freshness of this drink and the bubbles emanate a real fragrance of elderflower and citrus.”   

Given its name, this is obviously meant as a pre-dinner cocktail to help stimulate the appetite. From personal experience, it certainly fits the bill. 

**Recipes**  
* 40 mL Campari  
* 30 mL Noilly Prat dry vermouth  
* 30 mL St. Germain elderflower liqueur  
* orange and lemon twist  
Mix all ingredients and carbonate. Pour over ice. Alternatively, shake and strain.

**Results**  
I first made this cocktail shaking and straining it as per the alternative directions since it was a much easier way to give this cocktail a try. It was sweet, Campari-forward, fruity, lemony, and intriguing enough to motivate me to revisit it and give it its proper respect. I rarely use my SodaStream to carbonate cocktails, as I’ve had a few cases of it not working properly and I’m usually not in the mood for making a whole bottle worth of cocktail that needs to be consumed over the next couple days. That said, this one seemed worth investing in and ultimately I finished it a lot quicker than expected. In any case, the carbonated Aperitif cocktail starts with the distinctive bitter citrus nose of Campari with an added edge of acidity from the carbonation. Being comprised primarily of liqueurs and undiluted by any water, you would expect it to be very syrupy in the mouth, but because of the carbonation its heavy ingredients come out pleasantly full-textured. Flavor-wise, I was intrigued by an unexpected unique bitter quality on top of the Campari. It is not yet clear to me whether this is due to a reaction between the carbonation and something in Campari, the potential rapid infusion of the orange and lemon twists by carbonation, the lemon orange oils that I expressed before carbonation, or some combination of the above. In any case, in the mouth I first get an initial hit of citrus oil followed by the mild sweetness and a brief Campari bitterness on the palate. The St. Germain and dry vermouth show their profiles near the finish, providing a fleeting fruity note that returns to the dry citrus bitter profile of Campari on the finish. At the very end, the volatile citrus oils return for a second round on the palate. Having this mixture on its own without carbonation would probably be overwhelmingly sweet, so if you are unable to carbonate it, shaking on ice is a decent alternative method to tame these combination of ingreidents and balance this cocktail.

**Carbonating cocktails**  
Carbonating cocktails was very much a trend from a couple years ago that seems whose popularity seems to have died down a bit recently, though that could be due to the seasonal nature of wanting a light and fizzy cocktail. I believe I was first introduced to the idea of carbonated cocktails through Jeffrey Morgenthaler’s blog, as he pens a post on how he makes bottled carbonated cocktails in October of 2011 found [here](http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2011/bottled-carbonated-cocktails/). As far as I can tell, if he didn’t come up with this idea, he was at least the one who got it out there into the minds of many others. In it, he details how this can be beneficial for long drinks, such as the Americano, that already have a sparkling water component as you can perfectly control the amount of dilution both in terms of how much water you add and in minimizing further dilution from ice. Since this post, I feel many bartenders have experimented with carbonating cocktails, with particular interest in carbonating cocktails that may *not* normally have a sparkling component as it adds an interesting textural element without sacrificing the dilution that is a consequence of adding sparkling water or wine. The Negroni has been particularly amenable to carbonation, with its strong flavors lifted and lightened by the addition of bubbles, but carbonation is not limited only to strong-flavored and spirit-forward drinks as others have carbonated classic sours like the Corpse Reviver No. 2.    
Since 2011, Jeffrey Morgenthaler has recently provided an update on how to carbonate cocktails, though geared a little more towards the real bartender, providing detailed instructions on building your own carbonation rig utilizing a standard CO2 tank which can be found [here](http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2014/how-to-build-your-own-carbonation-rig/). I’m not sure exactly where I personally would have room to keep this setup, but if you have ample space, or already are homebrewing, perhaps you can give this a try. Instead, I simply use the SodaStream machine, which while not ideal, still performs admirably and does the job. It can be a bit touchy at times and seem risky with all the warnings not to carbonate anything other than water, but I’ve learned a couple details that seem to keep things working alright. Firstly, make sure you thoroughly chill whatever you want to carbonate. CO2 dissolves more readily in cold liquid, so you’re going to either need to make things ahead of time and leave it in the fridge overnight, or in my case, I used a handy ThermaPen to test the temperature and make sure it is below 4°C/39°F. If your liquid is cold, you can proceed with carbonation as usual, I typically give it two bursts each until the pressure triggers the relief valve. At this point, it is very important to let it sit and slowly relieve the pressure in the empty space. You will hear a faint hissing which is a result of the high pressure in the headspace of the bottle slowly being released. This is usually done quickly by lifting the bottle in the SodaStream, but with the thicker liquid of a cocktail, releasing it this way will usually result in it foaming up and spraying everywhere. It’s akin to quickly opening a bottle of soda, which is something we all understand how to do safely. After you’ve patiently released the pressure, you’re almost done, just don’t forget to clean the tip of the carbonation rig. I usually accomplish this by giving it a short blast with no bottle attached to blow out any liquid on the end and then wiping it with a wet paper towel. You don’t want to build up a sticky mess that could clog the carbonator. Finally, enjoy your cocktail! 

**Cheers!**  
If you enjoy Campari/St.Germain and have access to a SodaStream at home, consider giving this a try. It makes a nice light pre-dinner cocktail and thoroughly lives up to its name. Perhaps this will motivate you to explore carbonating other cocktails and if you do, or have done so, I’d love to hear about it in the comments. Hope you’re all still enjoying this series, please feel free to leave your feedback and questions below. Thanks to the anonymous user who gifted me with another month of reddit gold last week, it is much appreciated and noticed. Until next week dear readers, cheers!
