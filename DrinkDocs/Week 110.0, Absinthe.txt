**Not Cocktail of the Week #110: Chrysanthemum**  
With the recent official start of spring, I thought it would be nice to visit a cocktail that’s hung around in the back of my mind for a couple of years now (April 2013 according to my notebook), the Chrysanthemum. A light and fruity cocktail that stars dry vermouth as the main ingredient, it’s a great way to appreciate a fresh bottle of good dry vermouth and a perfect way to welcome the beginning of spring.  

**Background**  
The Chrysanthemum cocktail was first found in Hugo Ensslin’s *Recipes for Mixed Drinks* in 1916, but is more often credited to *The Savoy Cocktail Book*. While Ensslin’s book provides no additional history to the cocktail, a tagline in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* provides the following information: “Well-known and very popular in the American Bar of the S.S. Europa,” a German cruise liner that operated through the 1930s. Being able to make the transatlantic crossing in a mere 5 days, this was presumably a popular choice for those able and wishing to escape Prohibition. As for Hugo Ensslin, while he seems to have fallen into relative obscurity, he is the creator of the now well-known Aviation cocktail, which was inaccurately copied (sans crème de violette) into *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, amongst other recipes (with typos, duplicates, and such). You can read a bit more about Hugo Ensslin’s influence in [this article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/the-most-influential-cocktail-book-to-date/2011/10/04/gIQAoWxtcL_story.html) from the Washington Post or buy a modern reprint of his work [here](http://www.cocktailkingdom.com/recipes-for-mixed-drinks.html) at Cocktail Kingdom.

**Results**  
Naturally, I started with the recipe from *The Savoy Cocktail Book*. I used Dolin dry vermouth and measured 3 mL of absinthe rather than the 0.25 oz approximation that I came across. If 1 dash is the equivalent of 1 mL, 0.25 oz is more than double the appropriate amount. While some people find the 2:1 ratio of vermouth to Benedictine “cloying”, I actually found it rather enjoyable. This could result from using a relatively sweet dry vermouth (what an odd confluence of words) or having too much absinthe present. In any case, the nose of this Chrysanthemum was light and floral with a note of fresh citrus from the orange twist. With a significant fraction of syrupy Benedictine, it was moderately full-textured in the mouth and had a primarily sweet flavor. Despite that, Benedictine does still find itself in a supporting role in this cocktail, adding body and honey sweetness while complementing the herbal aspects of the dry vermouth. The dry vermouth is definitely the star here, so make sure you’re using a fresh bottle of something good. I first tasted the fruit notes of dry vermouth enhanced by absinthe, whose mild licorice note lingers through the honey sweet body until the pleasant herbal finish. I thought this was a very cheery cocktail and would be really quite nice for daytime drinking. However, along with Doug Ford, I personally do not have much of a palate for absinthe and could probably stand reducing it by a dash.  
While I’ve previously made the version from *The PDT Cocktail Book*, briefly noting it “light but surprisingly flavorful” in the margins, I also added a note asking “what if I used Lillet?” Interestingly, in writing this article, I saw mention of that as a possibility on Erik Ellestad’s Savoy Stomp, so I went ahead and mixed one up using Cocchi Americano, though elected to back off on the Benedictine by 0.25 oz to compensate for the sweetness. While I should note my bottle of Cocchi Americano is pretty old, I still found it quite palatable after a quick taste test. Unfortunately, this one definitely pushes the boundary into being “too sweet”. Outside of that, compared to the standard Chrysanthemum, there’s more fruit character, a distinct sugariness that seems to come from the absinthe and a more pronounced bitterness on the finish. This might be worth trying at a 4:1 ratio of vermouth to Benedictine, but I worry that you might start to lose the Benedictine flavor at that point. Well, not all experiments are successful, but regardless it was worth exploring to determine if it suited my palate. 

**Cheers!**
