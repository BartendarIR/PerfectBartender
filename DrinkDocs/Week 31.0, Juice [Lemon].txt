**Not Cocktail of the Week #31: Shaddock**  
For NCotW, I do my best to regularly feature both a variety of ingredients and a selection of simple, classic, and modern recipes. As I haven’t written about cocktails with the delicious St. Germain elderflower liqueur recently, I was searching for something to fill that hole and thought of the Shaddock, which conveniently happened to be shared by /u/justanothercook a few weeks ago [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1imftm/the_shaddockthe_nasturtium/). In any case, I figured I haven’t yet had the opportunity to research and write up a short bit on genever, one of the main components of this cocktail, so for this week’s NCotW, I present to you the Shaddock, a modern cocktail with an ancient spirit.

**Background**  
The Shaddock comes to us by way of Trina’s Starlite Lounge in Somerville, MA, likely popularized by the cocktail ~~virgin~~ slut blog ([link](http://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/)) a few years ago. Credit for its creation goes to Josh Childs, co-owner and bartender, who is probably better known for his cocktail column “*Straight Up*” on boston.com ([link](http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/food/blogs/cocktail/)), a subsidiary of the Boston Globe. Though I haven’t heard it called anything else, /u/justanothercook reports first encountering it as the Nasturtium at another restaurant, which while a pretty name, does the cocktail a disservice by failing to grasp the rationale behind its name.  
The shaddock is another name for the Southeast Asian fruit that I usually see called the pomelo (or sometimes pummelo). It resembles a very large grapefruit and in the store, seems to be a great bargain for the price, until you peel it at home and realize that it comes with a rind nearly an inch thick. The pomelo has very thick membranous materials surrounding its segments, so after peeling the rind, you also need to peel these off the segments themselves. Ultimately, you spend a lot of time peeling, but it can be extremely tasty. The pomelo comes in two varieties, pink and white, people often consider the white to be sweeter, but I actually prefer the pink variety myself because I enjoy the crisper texture and stronger flavor. In any case, the flavor profile of a pomelo closely resembles a grapefruit, though its flesh is firmer with a much stronger pith character in its taste. If you happen to see one at your local Asian market, give it a try and you’ll fully understand the name behind this cocktail.

**Results**  
As previously noted, if you’ve had a pomelo aka shaddock, you will fully understand the name behind this cocktail. It tastes remarkably like a pomelo with juicy grapefruit notes and a bitter pithy finish. If you haven’t, you will be stunned at how similar this tastes to a grapefruit (much like the Jasmine cocktail) without actually having grapefruit juice.  
It initially starts with a nose of lemon and the unique malty funkiness of genever. In the mouth I first taste the sweet floral and juicy character of St. Germain combined with the sweet component of Aperol, which transitions to the unique malty body of genever with a quick zing of tartness from lemon juice. The finish is the bitter component of Aperol combined with lemon oil and the botanicals of genever, which form a flavor remarkably like citrus pith.

**Variations**  
This cocktail, like the [Final Ward](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1d3j41/not_cocktail_of_the_week_16_final_ward/), is a variation on the delicious original Last Word cocktail. There are a couple variations in the same vein as the Shaddock that I came across, one being very close to the Last Word called the Latest Word, hailing from New York City’s Death + Co., substituting the funky malty genever for the gin in a Last Word. The other being the Word To Your Mom, also from Trina’s Starlite Lounge, which substitutes yellow chartreuse for the Aperol and maraschino liqueur for the St. Germain in a Shaddock. Also, I imagine gin would hold up relatively well in this cocktail rather than genever, which can be a challenge to find, so if you try that, let us know how it goes in the comments. 

**Genever**  
Since genever has been undergoing a bit of a slow revival over the last few years, having been “rediscovered” in the process of the classic cocktail renaissance, I thought I would spend a couple paragraphs going over what it is and why it’s important. Genever originated from the 16th century, as Dutch pharmacists sought a way to make their distilled malt wine more palatable by adding juniper and other botanicals to their product. Despite its relative obscurity, genever (aka jenever, Geneva gin, Schiedam gin, Dutch gin, or Holland gin) actually predates the styles of gin that we are familiar with today, with the British version arising in the 17th century as their attempt to imitate genever. In *Imbibe!* by David Wondrich, he concludes that the gin referred to in “Professor” Jerry Thomas’ 1862 edition of *How to Mix Drinks* is actually genever. In these recipes, “old gin”, which some people believe refers to the sweetened Old Tom gin, is more likely genever, as genever is actually aged. Mr. Wondrich reports that the London Dry style that we are most familiar with was not available in the United States until the 1890s, and the original sweetened American style gin, Old Tom, was not widely distributed until the 1880s. These two facts combined with the fact that Dutch gin was shown to be imported in large quantities through the 1870s leads him to conclude that originally Americans were drinking genever. Only in the 1880s, with the introduction of dry vermouth to the cocktail world, did things begin to shift as dry vermouth does not mix well with genever. As David Embury’s polarizing opinion on genever goes, “[it is] the finest of all gins for medicinal purposes...[but is] practically worthless because it will not blend with other flavors.” By Jerry Thomas’ 1887 revision of *How to Mix Drinks*, he specifies 12 cocktails utilizing genever and 8 using Old Tom gin. As a final nail in the coffin, Mr. Wondrich reports that “the only mention of unsweetened gin in America I’ve been able to find prior to the 1890s recommends its virtues as a fabric cleaner.” Typical American anti-British sentiment. :P  
Now that we’ve established the importance of genever, the next question is what is genever and how does it differ from the gin you normally encounter? Gin is typically made by distilling raw alcohol from barley or whatever fermentable grain on hand, then redistilling it with the addition of juniper berries and other botanicals in a column still. On the other hand, for genever the juniper and other botanicals were originally mixed in with the fermenting material and the whole mess distilled in a pot still, but modern genever is usually comprised partially of a traditional gin base blended with distilled malt wine. The flavor of genever comes out somewhere between gin and whiskey, carrying the botanical characteristics of gin, but the malty woodiness of whiskey. Sometimes genever is even aged in oak casks, which brings it even closer to a whiskey character. In *Imbibe!* Mr. Wondrich notes that genever can be difficult to source, suggesting a substitute may be possible by mixing 8 oz of Power & Son or Jameson Irish whiskey with 10 oz Plymouth gin. That said, he also notes that this is likely better suited for use in punch rather than a cocktail, but if anybody can’t find genever and wants to give this a try, I’d be interested in hearing the results.

**Cheers!**  
Though the ingredients this week are a little harder to find in a home bar, hopefully some of you will be able to give the Shaddock a try. For those of you missing these bottles, I’ll definitely be revisiting these ingredients in future cocktails, so it would not be a complete waste to pick them up. I don’t have very much experience working with genever, so if you have any good cocktails using it that you’d be willing to share, I’d love to hear about them. I hope you’ve enjoyed this week’s NCotW column, as usual your comments are all appreciated and until next week dear readers, cheers!
