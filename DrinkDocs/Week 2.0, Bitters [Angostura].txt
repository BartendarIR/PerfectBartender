**Not Cocktail of the Week #2: The Manhattan**

It was bound to be featured sooner or later, and as my favorite cocktail, I figured now was a good a time as any. Plus, I’d like to have at least one cocktail each month that can be achieved with a basic bar setup. This is going to be a really long one since I love this drink (I had to cut out almost 1/3 to fit the character limit), so go mix yourself a Manhattan, then come back and enjoy. 

**Background**

The most famous and fantastical origin story of this drink is that it was created in 1874 for a party thrown by Winston Churchill’s pregnant mother at the Manhattan Club in New York. Though a nice story, ultimately both David Wondrich in *Imbibe!* and cocktail historian William Grimes in *Straight Up or On the Rocks* debunked this story as she was not in New York at that time. The Manhattan Club does have records of a Manhattan cocktail being invented there, but without any date attached (date your notes!). The most likely, yet least confirmable, history of the Manhattan cocktail comes from William Mulhall, a bartender in New York in the 1880s. He claimed that the Manhattan cocktail was invented by a Broadway saloonkeeper known simply as “Black” in the 1860s, who I envision as a shadowy sorcerer of spirits. It’s a mysterious story, but amazing that this cocktail remains one of the most well-known today.

**Recipes**

*[My preferred Manhattan](http://i.imgur.com/AjdC1.jpg)*:

* 2.5 oz Rittenhouse Rye BIB [bottled-in-bond]

* 1.0 oz Dolin Rouge

* 2 dashes Angostura bitters

Stirred on ice and strained into a coupe glass

Garnished with homemade Montmorency cherries on a pick (in order of consumption): rye+Peychaud’s, spiced rum+cinnamon, amaretto (details below) 

Disclaimer: this is a stiff drink as 2.5 oz of 100 proof rye is equivalent to two normal 1.5 oz pour cocktails. I should probably halve this recipe but I can’t help myself.

*Manhattan Cocktail (No. 1)* [originally found in the 1887 edition of Jerry Thomas’ *Bar-tender’s Guide*]

* 2 dashes Curacao or Maraschino

* 1 pony rye whiskey [approx. 1 oz]

* 1 wineglass vermouth (mixed) [approx. 2 oz, equal parts sweet and dry?]

* 3 dashes Angostura bitters

* 2 lumps of ice

Shaken on ice and strained into a claret glass 

Garnished with a quarter of a slice of lemon in the glass

Two dashes of gum syrup optional

**Results**

If I were forced to choose only one cocktail to have the rest of my life, it would have to be this. I always forget how much I enjoy this cocktail, as I honestly cannot condone having one of these every night, but that first sip is like slipping into a custom-tailored suit. You remember how well it fits and how comfortable it is. The initial note is always the spiciness of the rye whiskey, which immediately matures into the fruitiness of vermouth that tames the drink, and evolves into the herbal and bitter notes provided between the vermouth and Angostura bitters. My garnish being three distinct cherries just adds upon the complexity of this drink. The first cherry being soaked in rye whiskey+Peychaud’s complement and amplify the spiciness of rye and briefly take this drink in the direction of a Sazerac. The spiced rum and cinnamon chip soaked cherry turns it exotic with the strong flavor of cinnamon playing a harmonious counterpoint to the cloves in Angostura bitters. Near the end of the drink I enjoy the amaretto soaked cherry, with its naturally complementary flavors. It provides a sweet finish to my drink and reminds me that one is probably enough. 

**Variations**

There are countless variations on a Manhattan cocktail; I’ll briefly go over a few here. The most common variation on a classic Manhattan is using bourbon in place of rye, common in the South. A less common variation is to substitute brandy, which, according to Dale DeGroff in *The Craft of the Cocktail*, is common in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The “Perfect Manhattan”, unfortunately not a literal epitome, is a Manhattan whose vermouth portion is equal parts of sweet and dry. Recently, artisanal distillers have started to put out unaged “white dog whiskey” aka moonshine.  A “White Manhattan” is often a Manhattan cocktail made with “white dog whiskey”, dry vermouth, orange bitters, and garnished with a lemon twist resulting in a clear cocktail that is Manhattan-inspired. I am personally not a fan as I find it barely has any resemblance to the flavor profile of a Manhattan cocktail, but it is an interesting variation you may encounter. On the note of lemon peel/twist, this is another acceptable garnish in a Manhattan, though be sure to properly express the lemon oil if you choose this route. 

**On Cherries**

Grocery store “maraschino cherries” in the United States are vile and as with many cocktail stories, this can all be traced back to Prohibition. Maraschino cherries, in the early 1900s when the cocktail scene was really getting its legs, were originally made from Marasca cherries sweetened and preserved in Maraschino liqueur, also made from Marasca cherries. Marasca cherries, native to Europe, are sour cherries, along with the Morello and Montmorency. In 1906, the USDA defined a Maraschino cherry as thus. Sweet cherries, such as the Royal Ann, were being grown in the United States and preserved in a similar fashion, but were required by law to be called “Imitation Maraschino Cherries”. 

When Prohibition was enacted in 1920, Maraschino cherries became much more difficult to import and demand as a cocktail garnish dropped. So the American entrepreneurial spirit came up with a novel way to prepare cherries using a chemical brine and preserving them in a sugar syrup rather than alcohol. By the time Prohibition was repealed in 1933, the American palate had already become accustomed to the sugary variety that we recognize as a “maraschino cherry” today. 

By 1940, the FDA had [redefined](http://1.usa.gov/ZYfba9) a maraschino cherry as “cherries which have been dyed red, impregnated with sugar and packed in a sugar syrup flavored with oil of bitter almonds or a similar flavor.” Interestingly, the original dye, Red Number 4, was banned in 1960 for having lethal toxic effects on dogs and only allowed for the “maraschino cherry” as they are technically not considered a foodstuff. Although the modern “maraschino cherry” is usually dyed with Red Number 40, I still wonder why bleach all the flavor and natural texture out of a cherry then reintroduce it in the form of sugar and artificial dye?

In summary, the “maraschino cherry” found in every American grocery store is vastly different from the original Maraschino cherry. Firstly, they are produced from sweet cherry varieties rather than sour. Secondly, they are preserved by chemical brine rather than alcohol. Thirdly, they are packed for storage in sugar syrup rather than maraschino liqueur. Finally, they are dyed with synthetic food dye, which may turn out to be toxic.

At this point, you may be asking yourself, what other options do I have? I will present to you three suitable options for garnishing your cocktails. The first, which I personally have not had the luxury of trying, is to purchase the Luxardo brand of Maraschino cherries, which to my knowledge are still produced from Marasca cherries, though not kept in Maraschino liqueur. The second, more budget-friendly option that I have found is to purchase the “Dark Morello Cherries in Light Syrup” from Trader Joe’s. I feel these are significantly better than the “maraschino cherry” as they are at least produced from a sour cherry variety and aren’t artificially dyed. The third, more creative option that I have indulged in, is to simply make your own from dried Montmorency cherries, which again can be found at Trader Joe’s. All I do is put them in a clean jar and cover them with my liquor of choice. There’s no limit to what you could use to flavor them, but I currently have them in rye whiskey+Peychaud’s, bourbon+Angostura, dark rum+cinnamon chips, cognac, and amaretto. Having a progression of cherries over the course of consuming your Manhattan is a lot of fun. 

**Manhattan Crimes**

I initially wrote in my outline that the greatest sin you can commit while making a Manhattan is to shake it. I am confident in saying that the great majority of people would agree with this sentiment. Seeing [Robert Hess’ explanation](http://bit.ly/On071t) as to how unacceptable it is was a formative moment in my cocktail education. Yet, in writing this post, both of the recipes I came across in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* have it shaken. I don’t think anyone’s mind is going to be changed by this fact, but if anybody is daring enough to give it a shot, let me know in the comments.  

I had a friend who, when we went out for happy hour, would always insist on his Manhattan being served on the rocks as he thought he was getting more booze in larger old-fashioned glass. He was summarily proven wrong I strained into an empty cocktail glass. Although it is technically acceptable for the Manhattan to be served on the rocks, I would argue that this eventually detracts from the drink as the ice melts and the drink is diluted. Unlike an Old-Fashioned, the Manhattan already has sweet vermouth to tame the fire of the whiskey, and thus I feel that the addition of ice is unneeded. Ultimately, I am more a proponent of drink what you enjoy, so if you enjoy your Manhattan on the rocks, I respect that. 
 
**Cheers!**

I can’t believe I wrote so much about Manhattans. I have nothing else to say but enjoy!
