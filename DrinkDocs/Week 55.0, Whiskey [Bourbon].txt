I highly recommend making Amaretto Sours with the Luxardo Amaretto. It is heads and shoulders above the DiSaronno. DiSaronno isn't really amaretto any more...since 2001, you can't find the word anywhere on the bottle.

Anyway, as always, brilliant write up. At this point, I think you qualify for the internet version of a "National Treasure."
