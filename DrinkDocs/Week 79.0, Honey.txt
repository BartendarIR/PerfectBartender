**Not Cocktail of the Week #79: Brown Derby**  
For this week’s NCotW, I want to share with everyone the Brown Derby, a simple cocktail that only calls for a single bottle of bourbon, rye, or blended Scotch. Recently, I seem to have a penchant for picking cocktails that go by multiple names (see the [Hoop La!](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2930tk/not_cocktail_of_the_week_77_hoop_la/)) and the Brown Derby is another, as it is also known as the De Rigueur. In any case, let’s look at this easy tasty cocktail comprised of whisk(e)y, grapefruit, and honey. 

**Background**  
Although the Brown Derby hails from the classic era of cocktails, there is scant history on how it came to be and what history there is seems confused. What is known is that the Brown Derby’s city of origin is Los Angeles, specifically Hollywood. According to Dale DeGroff, it is named after the [Brown Derby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Derby) restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard, which opened in 1926. However, most sources credit its actual creation to the Vendome Club, a rival club to the Brown Derby, owned by Billy Wilkerson. From *The PDT Cocktail Book*, the Brown Derby was first published in 1933 in *Hollywood Cocktails* by Buzza and Cardozo. It seems clear that the Brown Derby has its roots in Los Angeles, but why the incongruence in its naming? Why would it be created at one restaurant yet named after another? Some speculate that the credit for this cocktail might be in part from Douglas Fairbanks (you may remember him from my post on the [Mary Pickford](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/265iu6/not_cocktail_of_the_week_72_mary_pickford/)), a regular at both the Vendome Club and the Savoy, who encountered it first as the De Rigueur and brought it to the Vendome Club in his travels. If this is true, then the lineage of the Brown Derby actually has its roots from the Savoy Hotel in London. Erik Ellestad further delineates the origin of this drink as coming from *Here’s How*, by Judge Jr. in 1927, which calls for Scotch as a base spirit. 
> Hark, ye lads! Here’s the very latest drink! Three of these will knock you for a row of aspirins:
1/2 scotch;
1/4 grapefruit juice;
1/4 honey;
cracked ice.  

So if we are to believe the stories, the Brown Derby is a very well-traveled cocktail, originating from London as a Scotch-based De Rigueur, encountering the film star Douglas Fairbanks who brought it to the Vendome Club in LA, who named it after their rivals the Brown Derby. Cocktail history. Go figure.

**Results**  
Looking at the recipes, one thing that immediately strikes me is how much honey people put in this drink. Both the recipes from PDT and Milk + Honey have the equivalent of 3/8 oz honey, which while possibly more historically accurate, seems overly sweet. Oddly enough, in this case, I had to go with Dale DeGroff’s recipe from *Craft of the Cocktail* which has the equivalent of ¼ oz honey, as despite his penchant for overly sweet drinks, his was actually the least sweet among the modern books. Using his recipe with Bulleit bourbon, I first note the rarely encountered combination of grapefruit and bourbon in the nose. The bitter medicinal notes of grapefruit mingle nicely with a floral honey note and the sweet vanilla notes of bourbon. In the mouth the honey flavor is quite dominant, coming in strong up front with a slight citrus bitterness. As I didn’t find any white grapefruit, I used the sweeter and less acidic ruby red variety, so there was not much tartness in the resulting cocktail. The bourbon flavor rears its head near the finish, in particular some sweet vanilla notes amplified by honey and the woody oak notes brought forward by grapefruit.  
After this initial version, inspired by Erik Ellestad’s thoughts on the De Rigueur cocktail, I agreed that this unique flavor profile might actually go really well with Scotch whisky. I went with the same ratio from Dale DeGroff for this Scotch whisky version using Bank Note Scotch which is the equivalent of 1.5 tsp, though Erik Ellestad only uses 1 tsp. This came out significantly differently, as the smoke notes from the Scotch are able to steer the nose in a very different direction becoming Scotch dominant with a note of floral honey and the grapefruit in this case fading into the background. The flavor is much more complex, with just a touch of honey up front and the grapefruit and Scotch taking up the body, combining together smoothly. It finishes with a peaty Scotch note and a crisp grapefruit aromatic note on the palate. This version strikes an odd balance.  
I also came across some suggestions for using rye in this cocktail, so I tried it with my usual Rittenhouse rye. This returns to a nose primarily of honey and vanilla, though I get a bit more woody spice than the bourbon version. Being partial to rye, I really enjoyed this version that was sweet and spicy, tempered with a mild fruity grapefruit flavor, and finishing with a combination of wood, spicy and dry grapefruit bitterness. The higher proof of Rittenhouse serves very well here, as its stronger backbone carries the honey and grapefruit flavors well.   
I figured I’d do one last version returning to bourbon to attempt to adjust it to better suit my palate. The usual recipe came across a bit too sweet for me, so I upped the bourbon to a generous 2.5 oz serving. The bourbon note is much more assertive in the nose now, with strong oak, vanilla and caramel notes, joined by a hint of citrus. This version is still plenty sweet, but I found it better balanced on my palate with a more moderate honey and vanilla flavors up front, a sweet citrus note in the middle that brings forward the fruitiness of bourbon, and finishing with a lingering woody and occasional zing of grapefruit aromatics on the finish. Perhaps when this cocktail was originally conceived, whiskies were generally higher proof, but I have no historical evidence of my purely speculative opinion.  

**Cheers!**  
Hopefully many of you are able to try this simple drink. Even as an avid fan of honey, I highly recommend starting with the Dale DeGroff recipe and adjusting to your taste from there. I got plenty of honey flavor using that, though if you start with white grapefruit juice, more honey could be nice. It’s a great flavor combination that evokes memories of eating grapefruit drizzled with honey as a child, or for others grapefruit baked with brown sugar. I’m planning on next month being all Tiki drinks, so I’m deep into learning about rum/ron/rhum at the moment, but I’m excited for sharing all the stuff I’m learning with everyone here. As usual, any comments, discussion, feedback, or questions are welcome, as are your contributions in the form of a guest post, reddit gold, or a book from my [wishlist](http://amzn.com/w/LJIN08K4RTJW) to further my learning. I’ve got a simple and very popular cocktail planned next week, so until then, cheers!
