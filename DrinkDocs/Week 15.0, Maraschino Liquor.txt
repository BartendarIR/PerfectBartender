**Not Cocktail of the Week #14: Martinez**  
Thanks again to /u/ClamydiaDellArte for being a guest contributor last week, writing and article on the [Pegu Club](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1c3psn/not_cocktail_of_the_week_14_pegu_club/). For this week’s column on a classic cocktail, I decided to write about the Martinez, the underappreciated ancestor to the ever popular (for better or for worse) Martini.  

**Background**  
I should probably stop being surprised when researching a very old classic cocktail and finding that the stories surrounding its origins are murky. The Martinez cocktail is most commonly credited to “Professor” Jerry Thomas, showing up in the 1887 edition of The Bon Vivant's Companion: Or How to Mix Drinks. The story goes that “Prof.” Thomas created this drink in California for a patron traveling to Martinez, possibly during the gold rush. More recently, the cocktail historian David Wondrich concluded that it could not have been Jerry Thomas who created the Martinez, as it did not appear in his original print edition in 1862 and Jerry Thomas had been dead for two years when the 1887 edition was printed. Instead, David Wondrich reports that the Martinez first appeared in O.H. Byron’s Modern Bartender’s Guide from 1884. Regardless of its origins, the Martinez is widely accepted as the predecessor of the Martini cocktail. Despite its relative obscurity, the Martinez occupies a crucial juncture between two giants of the cocktail world, the Manhattan and the Martini. As Gary “gaz” Regan puts it succinctly, “born of the Manhattan...and is the father, or perhaps grandfather, of the Dry Gin Martini.” In fact, the early documentations of the Martini specify Old Tom gin and sweet vermouth, with the gradual change to London Dry gin and dry vermouth not occurring until the advent of the 20th century. Thus I feel that the Martinez is an important cocktail for any enthusiast to be informed of and try in order to better understand a large part of the history of cocktails in general.

**Results**  
To make the Martinez, I elected to use my newly acquired bottle of Tanqueray Malacca, which was accepted as the closest approximation of Old Tom gin until more recent products from Hayman’s and Ransom were released. Briefly, Old Tom gin is slightly sweeter than the London Dry style that people are most familiar with, but slightly drier than Genever or Holland gin. As obvious from the articles linked in the further reading section above, the long history of the Martinez has resulted in a wide variety of different recipes ranging from its original 1:2 ratio of gin to sweet vermouth, to more recent recipes calling for an inversion (if not more) of that ratio to 2:1 gin to sweet vermouth which better suit the modern spirit-forward palate. With that in mind, I elected to cut the difference and go with the recipes from *The Savoy Cocktail Book* and *The PDT Cocktail book*, which use a 1:1 ratio, which I felt would be close to the original spirit of the drink, while still accommodating the modern palate. I substituted Tanqueray Malacca for Hayman’s Old Tom gin as well as orange bitters in place of the Boker’s bitters that I do not own. I also elected to garnish with a homemade brandied cherry since it seemed appropriate for a Manhattan-esque cocktail, but also added a little blood orange blossom garnish to emphasize the citrus notes in the gin.
Tasting my Martinez cocktail, it starts with a sweet and fruity aroma of oranges, likely stemming from both the orange bitters and the fruity character of Tanqueray Malacca. Upon tasting, you can immediately understand how it lies halfway between a Manhattan and Martini, with elements of both drinks present. The significant contributions of sweet vermouth are immediately reminiscent of the profile of a Manhattan, but the crisp herbal nature of gin gives it a finish reminiscent of a Martini. I initially tasted the sweet and herbal notes of sweet vermouth, which smoothly transitioned into the notes of cinnamon and other spices and finishing with an unidentified vegetal note (maybe orange pith?). It was remarkably smooth and mild, probably due to both the lower proof of this cocktail, as well as the softness of Tanqueray Malacca.  This cocktail is definitely something I am happy curl up with and sip.  

**Variations**  
For much more detail on variations, I again recommend the links provided in the further reading section, but briefly, with a simple cocktail such as the Martinez, much variation can be had simply from trying different combinations of gin (genever, Old Tom, London Dry) and sweet vermouth. Finding the right combination and ratio to suit your taste could be a rather lengthy but interesting journey.  

**Sweet Vermouth**  
Given the large role of sweet vermouth in the history and recipe of the Martinez cocktail, I thought I would go into a little more detail about sweet vermouth, an essential cocktail ingredient. Sweet vermouth is a fortified wine flavored with additional botanicals which usually impart some bitter, herbal, and spicy flavors. Etymologically, the word vermouth comes from the German word for wormwood, wermut, which was commonly used as a flavoring agent in vermouth in the past (~16th century). Vermouths are made by infusing wine with a variety of herbs and spices, then finishing it by fortifying with a neutral grape spirit. Over time, two distinct styles of vermouth have emerged, which we now know as sweet and dry. Sweet vermouth differs from dry vermouth in a number of ways, but the most important is likely the additional sugar added to the fortified wine, with 10-15% sugar in sweet vermouth compared to <5% in dry vermouth. The invention of sweet vermouth is often credited to Antonio Benedetto Carpano, who is said to have brought it to Turin, Italy in 1786. The “original recipe” is still sold today as the venerated Carpano Antica vermouth.  
Originally taken as an apéritif, vermouth has become an essential cocktail ingredient found in all variety of cocktails, but most often an accompaniment with whiskies. As it is a wine, not a spirit, it should be stored in the refrigerator and used as fresh as possible to avoid the flavors changing from oxidation. I thought it would be interesting to briefly go through a list of some of the most common sweet vermouths and the opinions/flavor profiles of each below.  
*Carpano Antica* – the big granddaddy of sweet vermouth; it is incredibly rich, layered, and complex; notes of fig, vanilla, citrus fruit, and a notable herbal bitter finish.  
*Dolin Rouge* – my preferred brand for sweet vermouth; a lighter and less sweet interpretation from France; notes of dried fruits and honey.  
*Punt e Mes* – produced by the makers of Carpano Antica; halfway between a sweet vermouth and amaro; similar to Carpano Antica but stronger bitterness from gentian root.  
*Noilly Prat* – another sweet vermouth from France; more woody notes as some parts of it are aged in oak; notes of citrus and cinnamon spice.   
*Martini and Rossi* – the most widely distributed and abused sweet vermouth found under kitchen cabinets everywhere; much sweeter and thicker; light on herbal notes and bitterness.  
*Vya* – a domestic sweet vermouth; I’ve never had it.  
*Cocchi Vermouth di Torino* – a relatively new well-regarded sweet vermouth; another one I have yet to try.  
*More* – there is a new movement to produce small-batch artisanal vermouths, but I am not very familiar with them. If you know more or have a good suggestion for these, I’d love to hear it.
