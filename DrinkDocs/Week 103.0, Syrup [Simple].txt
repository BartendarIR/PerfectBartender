**Not Cocktail of the Week #103: Hot Toddy**  
Merry Christmas everyone, hope you’re all enjoying time with your respective families and loved ones. For this week’s NCotW, I felt like sharing a simple warm winter drink familiar to many, the Hot Toddy. It’s a great way to warm up, relax, and unwind after all the holiday hustle and bustle.  

**Background**  
The origins of the Hot Toddy are simultaneously clear and murky as, despite the traceable lineage and written history of it, there is considerable variation over the years and no clear consensus that I am able to ferret out with this simple cocktail. According to David Wondrich, the earliest written mention of the Toddy comes from the 1750s in which a Scottish doctor recommends the Toddy as a health drink, stating that, “The spirit must have something to act on, and therefore acts on the sugar and does nae injury to the stomach.” Over the next century, Americans enjoyed the Toddy both hot and cold; made with a wide variety of spirits such as rum, applejack, or even gin; sweetened with sugar, honey, or molasses; and taken with or without nutmeg. This flexibility and inconsistency in the recipe may contribute to the lack of consensus to this day, but perhaps that is part of the appeal as it is a drink that can serve many functions. In 1862, Jerry Thomas formalized the Whiskey Toddy as a simple cold drink, essentially sweetened watered down whiskey. The version we are more familiar with today comes closest to his Hot Whiskey Sling recipe which is a hot, but unsweetened, watered whiskey with a garnish of grated nutmeg on top. A few decades later, in the 1890s, Americans rediscovered Scotch whisky, particularly blended Scotch, finding it particularly palatable in both the Hot Toddy and [Rob Roy](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2owdug/not_cocktail_of_the_week_101_rob_roy/).   
According to Dale DeGroff, it was also around this time that a squeeze of lemon juice or a twist of lemon peel found its way into the recipe for a Hot Toddy. However, David Wondrich argues that the addition of lemon peel makes it a Whisky Skin. Further confusing the matter, David Embury tries to codify the difference between the Toddy and the Sling which are both “mixtures of sweetened spirits and water.” According to him, the Sling can be served both hot and cold, includes lemon juice and either sugar or a sweet liqueur, and use charged water or ginger ale when served cold. On the other hand, the Toddy is traditionally a hot drink, include only a thin slice of lemon or piece of lemon peel, have the addition of some spices, and are only made with plain water. You can appreciate from the variety of recipes that there is no real agreed upon consensus for a Hot Toddy/Sling/Skin, but upon trying a variety of recipes, I think that the appropriate recipe might depend mostly on personal taste and purpose.

**Results**  
I tried many versions of the Hot Toddy, trying to find the best recipe. Ultimately I concluded that the best Hot Toddy recipe mostly will depend on your personal taste and a little bit on the occasion. Hopefully my notes will help guide you to a potential starting point for your own Hot Toddy. While people seem to either love or hate Famous Grouse blended Scotch, I found its relatively soft grain and dried fruit character made it very suitable for drinking warm in a Hot Toddy and it was my preferred choice for the Hot Toddy.  
The first version I tried was the recipe from my trusty copy of *Joy of Mixology* which brews some spices in hot water before adding honey and dark spirit of your choice (I went with Scotch). This version was one that I felt would be very good perhaps after a day spent shoveling snow as it was very soothing going down. The nose was of citrus, dried fruit, and spice. In terms of flavor, it was mostly a harmonious combination of Scotch and honey, finishing with the spices.  
After that version I decided I didn’t really like drinking my Hot Toddy with a bunch of spices floating in it and while they contributed slightly to the nose, I didn’t find they contributed much to the flavor. I had an epiphany in the shower (typical) while thinking about the Hot Toddy realizing that instead of whole spices, why not just add a few drops of Angostura bitters since it has notes of both clove and cinnamon. I described this Hot Toddy as smelling “warm and comforting like a cozy blanket” with notes of lemon and dried fruit in the nose. Upon sipping, this version was smooth and velvety in the mouth with warm fruit, sweet honey, and a touch of wood. This ended up being one of my favorite versions of the Hot Toddy and was really well-suited as a nightcap.  
Some people enjoy adding lemon juice to their Hot Toddy and so I made [this recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/14gltf/whats_your_favourite_recipe_for_a_hot_toddy/) from an old reddit thread that increases the amount of honey, adds lemon juice, and uses a bit less water. This version had less dried fruit character in the nose and was much more dominated by lemon. Texturally, it was still quite thick and full-textured from the honey. Flavor-wise this one had less Scotch character, only showing up at the end, instead mostly flavored with lemon and honey making it sweet and tart. I felt this version would be ideal for when you’re suffering from a cold as the additional honey helps soothe the throat and the lemon aroma refreshes the nose.  
Others insist that the Hot Toddy be made with bourbon or rye whiskey, so I tried the version in the *12 Bottle Bar* book which uses sugar and rye whiskey, garnished with a lemon twist and grated nutmeg. I chose to use Old Overholt here as I find it relatively mild, fruity, and not too woody as woodiness can unpleasantly dominate a hot drink. This was significantly different from all the previous blended Scotch and honey based Hot Toddies. It started with a lot of spice and nutmeg notes in the nose with a touch of lemon. I later got some woody notes with apple and pear that might be specific to Old Overholt. Without honey, this version felt thinner in texture and lacked the warm dried fruit flavor from Famous Grouse. Its flavor was much simpler, with a mild woody note of rye whiskey up front, a clean sweetness from sugar, and a finish of grain and spicy nutmeg. While I love bourbon and rye whiskey, I find that generally the fresh oak they are aged in can easily overpower in a hot drink, but maybe that’s just me.  
Finally, a lot of recipes call for using hot tea as a base rather than hot water, so I tried a Hot Toddy using Rooibos tea as a good Rooibos is described as having notes of honey, caramel, wood and spice, which are very complementary to the flavors of a Hot Toddy. I elected to use Bank Note blended Scotch in this case as I felt the additional complexity from tea called for a slightly more assertive Scotch. This version had a rich woody tea and lemon aroma and was actually very similar to the second version though a bit better-rounded by the tea and had a much more interesting floral finish. Despite having an identical amount of honey, I felt this one had a less viscous mouthfeel somehow, perhaps due to a mild astringent quality from the tea. The slight touch of smoke was also really nice here, complementing the tea very well. This version felt like one to slowly sip on when in a contemplative mood.  

**Cheers!**  
Five Hot Toddies later, I’m left concluding that there’s no best Hot Toddy recipe, there’s only one best for your situation. Hopefully you’ll have the opportunity to experiment on your own and share your Hot Toddy recipe here as well as the usual questions and comments. Merry Christmas!
