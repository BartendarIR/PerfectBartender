**Not Cocktail of the Week #85: Jungle Bird**  
Welcome back to the third installment of NCotW Tiki Edition! I first heard of the Jungle Bird through /r/cocktails and fell in love with it as a modern Tiki drink that manages to use Campari beautifully. A write-up of it in NCotW is definitely overdue, so this is a great opportunity to share it with those that may not have heard of it and get a bit of an education on Jamaican rum along the way. 

**Background**  
The Jungle Bird is a relatively recent Tiki concoction, credited to the Aviary Bar at the Kuala Lumpur Hilton hotel in 1978. It was first published in John J. Poister’s *New American Bartender’s Guide* in 1989, but languished in obscurity until it was unearthed and published in Jeff “Beachbum” Berry’s *Intoxica* in 2002. Since then, it has become very popular, particularly among the bitter-loving cocktail crowd, with notable bartenders putting their own personal stamp on it, with the better modifications and improvements becoming integrated into the modern recipe you are likely to encounter today. Giuseppe Gonzalez at Painkiller in New York changed the dark Jamaican rum in the original to the much more molasses-forward and intensely flavored black strap rum. Theo Lieberman from Milk + Honey fell in love with this version of the Jungle Bird, but put his own personal spin on it by decreasing the pineapple juice from 4 oz to 1.5 oz, bringing the intense black strap rum and Campari flavors forward. This seems to be where the cocktail generally stands today, but people continue to tinker with the Jungle Bird though, with The Aviary in Chicago fittingly taking it to new heights (seen [here](http://www.timeout.com/chicago/food-drink/the-best-cocktail-in-chicago-right-now-the-jungle-bird-at-the-aviary)) using spherified rum balls and layering the ingredients, making it a very visually striking drink.

**Results**  
While in the past I’ve resorted to using Kraken as my “dark rum” in a Jungle Bird, a relatively recent trip to Bevmo finally yielded the Cruzan Black Strap rum that I’ve searched for to use in this recipe. I was very excited to stumble across this bottle as my search for Coruba continues to be fruitless. While I still need to pick up a proper dark Jamaican rum, the Cruzan Black Strap is simply amazing in this cocktail. Cruzan Black Strap has a very strong molasses character that cuts through in drinks using it, this being no exception. The Jungle Bird has a robust molasses note in the nose, along with a bit of fresh lime and a distinct herbal note that I attribute to the combination of Campari with molasses. In the mouth the pineapple comes in first, but combines with the unique flavor of blackstrap molasses giving it a roasted and smoky aspect. The body is a familiar and refreshing balance of sweet and sour elements blended together and bolstered by the rum backbone that I associate with Tiki. I got a surprising burst of sweetness near the finish, whose source I wasn’t able to identify. The finish of this cocktail is impressively long and lingering with a combination of smoke, dark molasses, medicinal herbs, coffee, and the dry bitterness of Campari. Because the Campari and blackstrap rum are so assertive, I personally found that using a canned juice doesn’t detracts much from its flavor when compared to fresh muddled and strained pineapple juice. There was maybe a bit more pineapple character in the nose and palate, but it didn’t seem significant to me. 

**Jamaican Rum**  
The past two weeks I have covered “French-style” Rhum Agricole aka Rhum Martinique and “Spanish-style” Cuban/Puerto Rican rum, but this week we will tackle the last major style of rum, which is the “English-style” Jamaican rum. Rum in Jamaica got its start in the 16th century with the introduction of sugar cane by the Spanish, which was used to make the rough and unrefined aguardiente. When the British captured Jamaica in the 17th century, they increased the production of both sugar and rum, bringing their experience with distillation on pot stills to Jamaica. The most well-known and primary producer of Jamaican rum is Appleton Estate. Established in 1749 by Frances Dickinson, it is considered the world’s second-oldest spirit, predated only by Mount Gay on Barbados in 1663 or 1703, and followed by St. James on Martinique in 1765. Over the centuries (how often do you get to say that), ownership of Appleton Estate changed hands numerous times, but it is currently owned by J. Wray and Nephew Ltd., another producer of Jamaican rums, who are well-known for their overproof rum used in the unofficial national drink of Jamaica, the Wray and Ting.   
The rums from Appleton Estate are still produced entirely on-site with growing sugar cane, refining sugar, fermenting molasses, distilling, and aging all happening on the original 11,000 acre estate in the Nassau Valley. Approximately 3,700 acres are dedicated to growing sugar cane, enough to produce up to 160 tons of sugar per day and ten million liters of rum per year. While Cuban/Puerto Rican rums generally use faster and cleaner strains of yeast, Jamaican rums are unique by traditionally using the yeast-rich foam leftovers from the previous distillation referred to as dunder to start fermentation. There is surprisingly little on the internet about dunder, but on the surface it is similar to the sour mash process used for certain whiskies and acts to enrich for slow-acting and more flavorful yeast strains. However, additional components are added to dunder to encourage not only yeast growth, but particular bacterial fermentations that contribute flavor to the final product. These can range from rather unsurprising (overripe fruit), to odd (rotten fruit), to fucking weird (decomposing bats?!). The best articles on dunder that I could find was from an interview with Bryan Davis from Lost Spirits on the K&L Spirits Journal (click [here](http://spiritsjournal.klwines.com/klwinescom-spirits-blog/2014/2/5/rum-super-geekdom.html)) and a brief discussion on eGullet (click [here](http://forums.egullet.org/topic/142091-understanding-rum/page-3)). In the year-long process of aging dunder in traditional wood-lined pits, natural soil bacteria produce carboxylic acid which in turn the yeast takes to produce esters, contributing to the fruity and funky flavors of Jamaican rum. While there is no mention of the pungent dunder being used for fermentation at Appleton Estate on their website, they claim that they convert their dunder into fertilizer used on their sugar cane fields. Regardless, Appleton Estate then distills the fermented molasses on five copper pot stills before aging in ex-bourbon white oak barrels for the appropriate amount of time before producing their blends. Varying the starting molasses and the time spent barrel aging results in either gold or dark Jamaican rum, though there doesn’t seem to be any hard rules about what distinguishes the two on the surface other than color.  
While still produced from molasses, Jamaican rum is distinct from Cuban/Puerto Rican rum in that it is primarily distilled on pot stills, resulting in a distillate that retains much more molasses flavor. 
This week’s Tiki cocktail calls for either dark Jamaican rum or black strap rum, both of which are legal and available in the United States unlike last week’s Cuban-style rum. In terms of black strap rum, I’m unaware of any options other than Cruzan Black Strap, but if anyone knows better, please let me know. Jeff “Beachbum” Berry recommends Appleton Special Gold, Appleton Estate V/X, or Lemon Hart Gold (if available) for gold Jamaican rum. For dark Jamaican rum, he recommends Myer’s if you’re looking for a molasses note, Coruba for brown sugar character, or Appleton Estate Extra for its oak and caramel flavor. The “5 Minutes of Rum” podcast that has helped a lot with my rum education features Appleton Estate V/X as their choice for gold Jamaican rum and Coruba for their dark Jamaican rum, but more suggestions can be found on the substitutions guide [here](http://5minutesofrum.com/substitutions/). To finish this section, I would be remiss not to mention a very unique Jamaican rum, [Smith & Cross](http://www.alpenz.com/images/poftfolio/smithcross114rum.htm). Bottled at Navy strength (114 proof), this rum is produced from two different pot stills in the traditional fashion, which are aged separately for differing amounts of time, before blending together and resulting in a tremendously aromatic and funky rum. While I would not be comfortable using this solely as a replacement for gold Jamaican rum, it can really add a wallop to certain cocktails and punches. If there are any interesting recipes people particularly enjoy Smith & Cross in, please share them below.
