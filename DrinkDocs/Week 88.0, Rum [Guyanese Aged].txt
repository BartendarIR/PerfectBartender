**Not Cocktail of the Week #88: Navy Grog**  
It’s the final week of NCotW Tiki Edition and we’ve certainly covered a lot of ground. Over the course of the last previous five weeks, I’ve certainly learned a lot about the five major styles of rum, starting with Rhum Agricole in the [Three Dots & A Dash](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2ct529/not_cocktail_of_the_week_83_tiki_edition_three/), then Cuban/Puerto Rican rum in the [Hotel Nacional Special](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2dgqc3/not_cocktail_of_the_week_84_tiki_edition_hotel/), followed by Jamaican rum in the [Jungle Bird](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2e3p09/not_cocktail_of_the_week_85_tiki_edition_jungle/), Barbados rum in the [Royal Bermuda Yacht Club](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2ergog/not_cocktail_of_the_week_86_tiki_edition_royal/), and finally Demerara rum last week in the [Queen's Park Swizzle & 151 Swizzle](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2fdo9o/not_cocktail_of_the_week_87_tiki_edition_queens/). It’s been an incredibly educational experience and has filled out my rum selection nicely, but to finish, I’ll not introduce any new rums but instead use three of these styles of rum in a classic Tiki drink, the Navy Grog.

**Background**  
According to *Beachbum Berry Remixed*, the Navy Grog was created by Don the Beachcomber in 1941. The Navy Grog, alongside his more famous Mai Tai and Zombie, made up the holy trinity of Tiki cocktails. A strong concoction comprised of three different types of rum, this traces is inspired by the classic Grog, whose origins are traced to Vice Admiral Edward Vernon of the British Royal Navy in August of 1740 (read more about Grog in my post about the [Bumbo & Rum Manhattan](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/27wec2/not_cocktail_of_the_week_75_bumbo_rum_manhattan/)). The Navy Grog was traditionally served in an old-fashioned glass with a frozen snow cone of shaved ice with a straw running through it and this unique touch was one of its defining factors. The success and popularity of the Navy Grog attracted imitators, one of which was of course Trader Vic. While Don’s recipes kept his recipes secret, Trader Vic was always more successful in marketing and publicizing his recipes. To that end he formulated his own version of the Navy Grog using pimento dram, published its recipe in 1972, and later sold a Navy Grog mix, which can occasionally still be found today (link to a taste test found below).

Pack a pilsner glass with finely shaved ice, run a chopstick through the middle to make a hole for the straw, and then gently remove cone from glass. Freeze cone overnight. When ready to serve, run straw through cone. Sip drink through straw.

**Results**  
I first had this as my final drink at Smuggler’s Cove after tasting their Three Dots & A Dash, Hotel Nacional Special, and Queen’s Park Swizzle. Since I usually get there very early to avoid lines and have an opportunity to talk to the bartender, I imparted to him that I was writing a cocktail feature and that my previous drinks were all selected to highlight different rums. I then asked if he thought there was anything I was missing anything and without a word he gave me a Navy Grog. After having it and learning more about it, the more I see how great a choice this was. Not only does it utilize most of the major styles of rum, but it is also a very important drink with actual history and Tiki history. I believe the version at Smuggler’s Cove uses Denizen rum for the Puerto Rican rum, Smith & Cross as the Jamaican rum, and Angostura 7-year (not sure if I saw correctly since this isn’t a Demerara). They don’t serve theirs with the traditional ice cone, instead garnishing with a generous sprig of mint. The nose was of mint and the ester-packed funky banana notes of Smith & Cross. In the mouth the flavor was unique, funky and spicy with a mild citrus note, finishing surprisingly bitter with notes of sugar cane. Interestingly, Smuggler’s Cove uses Trader Vic’s recipe, which uses pimento dram instead of honey.  
At home, I used my usual Flor de Cana 4-year as the Puerto Rican rum, Coruba (super psyched to finally have found a bottle of this) as my dark Jamaican rum, and El Dorado 12-year as my Demerara rum in Don the Beachcomber’s recipe. This was another amazing Tiki drink with that magical quality of blending ingredients together almost seamlessly into more than the sum of its parts, much like the Three Dots & A Dash. The nose was primarily of rum, a mild Jamaican funk from the Coruba with sweet floral notes of honey and a hint of smoky caramel from the El Dorado. I didn’t get as much mint as I did at Smuggler’s Cove since my sprig was relatively small compared to theirs. Flavor-wise, I get a light tartness up front that is subtly amplified by the sparkle of fresh soda water, Jamaican rum seems to takes center stage in the body bolstered by the relatively neutral Puerto Rican rum, then the honey and Demerara sugar come through near the finish along with some bitter lime and grapefruit notes. Much like the Queen’s Park Swizzle, this is another dangerously smooth cocktail that gets away with a generous 3 oz pour of rum. The way the individual ingredients play together is interesting to me as the two oft-paired combinations of grapefruit/honey and rum/lime somehow manage to complement each other in a magical way.  
I also tried the Trader Vic version, using the same rums (with an extra touch of Smith & Cross), but preferred Don the Beachcomber’s recipe. The aroma is very pleasant with a great balance of rum funk, allspice and a bit of citrus. In the mouth it is a bit funky with rich rum flavor up front, then spice and citrus coming through more in the middle. Perhaps I am not accustomed to using this new bottle of St. Elizabeth allspice dram, but it really overpowered the drink on the finish, with allspice being the primary finish that lingers too long on the palate. A lot of people have expressed a preference for the Trader Vic version because the pimento dram adds a unique depth to the drink, but if I were to do this again, I’d consider backing off on the pimento dram and compensating with a bit more syrup and grapefruit juice.

**Variations**  
There is no shortage of Tiki cocktails based off the classic Grog. In *Beachbum Berry Remixed* there are at least five other cocktails with Grog in their name and more that are clearly based off of Grog such as the Ancient Mariner, which was concocted to recreate Trader Vic’s Navy Grog.
