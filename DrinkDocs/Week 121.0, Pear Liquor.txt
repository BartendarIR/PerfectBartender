**Not Cocktail of the Week #121: Little Miss Annabelle**  
In order to try and have more regular content, I’m going to make an honest effort to have more short posts since the lengthy write-ups don’t seem to be worth the time. I’ll still do them when a drink merits the research, but I’m going to give this new format a try. This week I’m sharing a particularly tasty drink I stumbled upon recently that will be featured at my upcoming “Not Annual Cocktail Party”. 

**Background**  
The Little Miss Annabelle is found in the *Death & Co.* book and credited to Joaquin Simo, also creator of the [Latin Quarter](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2vkgdm/not_cocktail_of_the_week_107_latin_quarter/) and [Kingston Negroni](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/38e4cc/not_cocktail_of_the_week_116_kingston_negroni/). In his words, “I named this variation on the Sidecar after the daughter of Alexandre Gabriel, who owns Pierre Ferrand. It has a rich mouthfeel for using such a small amount of sweetener.” 

**Recipes**  
*Death & Co.*, David Kaplan, 2014  
* 2 oz Pierre Ferrand Ambre Cognac  
* 0.25 oz Mathilde Poire pear liqueur  
* 0.25 oz Benedictine  
* 0.75 oz lemon juice  
* 0.25 oz simple cane sugar syrup  
* 1 dash house Peychaud’s bitters  
Shake all the ingredients with ice, then strain into a coupe. No garnish. 

**Results**  
Instead of the Pierre Ferrand Ambre Cognac, I used the Cognac I recently acquired from K&L, [Claude Thorin VS](http://www.klwines.com/p/i?i=1170909), as I wanted to try to see how a relatively cheap Cognac compared to the Paul Masson VSOP I usually stock. This Cognac seemed brighter and fruitier, with distinct grape and apple notes and finishing with a nice caramel flavor. Additionally, instead of the Mathilde Poire, I used a different pear liqueur, St. George spiced pear liqueur.  
I think this drink (with modifications) is an amazing drink for autumn. The Cognac provides a pleasant fruity apple note to complement the pear liqueur, while the spices in the pear liqueur complement the spiciness of Peychaud’s. This drink has multiple layers of interaction for its ingredients, all of which work out beautifully. I find this cocktail starts with a mild fruit and spice note in the nose, since it lacks any twist as garnish. Upon tasting, it has layers of sweet fruit, warm spice, with a mild herbal complexity. I’ve been trying to find or concoct a drink that successfully uses the St. George spiced pear liqueur, but never quite succeeded. It turns out that instead of trying to feature it as a main ingredient, it works best as an accent, bolstered by other flavors. Despite its relatively small part in the final drink, its flavors really shine through here.

**Cheers!**  
Let me know what you think of this more abbreviated format. It is much less work for me in terms of photography/editing/research, so it might allow for more regular posts. Perhaps I’m taking inspiration from /u/cocktailvirgin in making these more straightforward, simply featuring things that I drink rather than mini research projects like the last post on the [Saturn](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/3nha24/not_cocktail_of_the_week_120_saturn/). Anyways, let me know what you think about this drink or this format, and as usual until next time, cheers!
