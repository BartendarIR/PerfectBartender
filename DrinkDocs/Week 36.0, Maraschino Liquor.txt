**Not Cocktail of the Week #36: Armistice**  
A short but sweet NCotW this week, featuring a tasty modern cocktail that lies somewhere between the [Final Ward](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1d3j41/not_cocktail_of_the_week_16_final_ward/) (a variation on the Last Word) and a Dry Manhattan. This is another great drink that transitions us from the refreshing sours of summer to the more spirit-forward cocktails we crave as the weather gets colder.

**Background**  
The Armistice was originally concocted by Erik Hakkinen, one of the bartenders at Zig Zag Café in Seattle, at which Murray Stenson rediscovered and popularized the Last Word cocktail. If you’re ever in Seattle, this is one classic bar that you shouldn’t miss.

**Recipes**  
* 1.5 oz Rittenhouse rye  
* 0.5 oz Noilly Prat dry vermouth (substitute Dolin)  
* 0.25 oz Green Chartreuse  
* 0.25 oz Luxardo maraschino liqueur  
* 2 dashes Fee’s Whiskey Barrel Bitters (substitute Angostura bitters)  
Stirred on ice, strained. No garnish.

**Results**  
This is definitely a hybrid between the delicious Final Ward cocktail and a Dry Manhattan. It has a very pleasant nose, smelling surprisingly refreshing with sweet herbal notes that later become spicy rye and cinnamon. Because of the significant liqueur components, this cocktail is very full-textured. Upon tasting, I was initially quite surprised by the strong chartreuse element which transitions to the spicy notes of rye and woody note from maraschino on the finish. It ends with the familiar lingering bitter spiciness of Angostura bitters. Despite this cocktail not asking for any garnish, I felt like a nice maraschino cherry would not go out of place in this delicious pre-dinner cocktail. 

**Cheers!**  
Apologies for the abbreviated post this week, there isn’t as much material to cover for modern cocktails and I was a bit short on time this week. Still, I did manage to accomplish writing up another cocktail I enjoy with green chartreuse. As usual, if anybody wants to share about a personal favorite cocktail of their own, feel free to drop me a message and you could be a guest writer on reddit’s NCotW column. Otherwise, your feedback and questions are always welcome. Thanks to all for the continued support and cheers!
