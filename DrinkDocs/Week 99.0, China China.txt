**Not Cocktail of the Week #99: The Brooklyn**

Happy Thanksgiving and welcome to this week’s Not Cocktail of the Week. Thanks to /u/hebug for letting me write up this weeks post while he is traveling for the holiday. I had originally planned for this post in January, but now will works out great, as this is my Thanksgiving cocktail. This weeks post is about the Brooklyn cocktail. A slightly obscure cocktail that is similar to a dry Manhattan, yet offers much more. This drink is a great whiskey cocktail for the fall season, and offers some additional warmth with the addition of an orange-based French amaro, Amer Picon.


**Background**

The Brooklyn is one of the five cocktails named after the five boroughs of New York. The most famous of which, I’m sure you have all had is the Manhattan cocktail. The four others are the Bronx cocktail, the Queens cocktail, The Staten Island Ferry cocktail, and of course the Brooklyn cocktail.


The Brooklyn is first found in J.A. Grohusko's Jack's Manual published back in 1910. You can [download a copy of this vintage cocktail book here] (https://archive.org/download/jacksmanualonvin00groh/jacksmanualonvin00groh.pdf) for FREE! This cocktail appears in almost every pre-prohibition cocktail book I could find. It was undoubtedly popular at the time. What happened?


Amer Picon disappeared from the US market, and adding insult to injury in the recipe changed along with being bottled at a lower proof later on in the 1970s. So prepare to [spend a lot]( https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/P-10044.aspx) for a bottle of authentic Amer Picon. Although two substitutes exist in Europe only, Amer Picon Club and Amer Picon Biere, these are still just substitutes with different recipes and proof than the original. The good news is that there are great alternatives available, and this cocktail should **not** be ignored just because we have lost Amer Picon.


Of the substitutes, Torani Amer, appears to be the most popular, yet falls short of the great complexities of the original Amer Picon (or so I’m told). Jamie Bourdeau of Canon up here in Seattle came up with a recipe for creating your own Amer Picon substitute, called Amer Boudreau. This craft Amer uses Ramazzotti, an amaro high in sweetness with a light pastis flavor of fennel and star anise, along with orange and blood orange to help create the flavor of Amer Picon. Amer Boudreau is great, and well worth the wait for infusing. You can find the recipe below to make your own, my Amer Boudreau is still in the process of being created, as the orange tincture takes a month to infuse, but I have tasted it before and it is a great substitute. 


However another Seattle bar, Zig Zag Café, turned me onto Bigallet China China Amer, another amer with lots of zesty orange flavor. I found my bottle at Whole Foods but I have not seen it anywhere else. China China has become my preferred Amer Picon substitute to enjoy in a Brooklyn cocktail. It has a similar flavor profile to the Amer Boudreau, yet less spicy and more orange.


I have also seen it suggested to use Ramazzotti in place of Amer Picon. Although I would add a dash or so of orange bitters as Ramazzotti does not have the intense orange profile that China China or Amer Boudreau. When without a suitable Amer, or the time/desire to make your own, a couple dashes of Angostura and Orange bitters works and is still very enjoyable in this cocktail.

**Results**

If you don’t have Amer Picon, Torani Amer, Bigallet China China Amer, or Ramazzotti, just use a couple shakes of angostura and orange bitters. This is a fine substitute and still results in a great cocktail. The first Brooklyn I made used the PDT recipe with the substitution of bitters. This version is slightly less sweet, and the nose is full of spicy rye and tangy citrus from the Dolin vermouth. The flavor of this recipe really comes from the rye and bitters. I was surprised how much I missed the maraschino until it shines during the finish. You could almost call this version an “Improved Dry Manhattan Cocktail”, but that is a mouthful and a “Brooklyn” will do just fine.


The second Brooklyn I made was with China China using my preferred ratio. Here the rye really seams to stay even with the citrus from the Dolin and China China. The extra sweetness from China China Amer helps counter balance the dryness from the additional ¼ oz of French vermouth. The flavor is sweet and spicy full of aromatic spices like clove, cinnamon, and gentian all dominated by citrusy orange and the wonderful fruit forward Dolin. The finish surprised me, as it is almost slightly sour from the maraschino and vermouth.


**Amer Boudreau**

This is a scaled down recipe so you don’t have to go out and buy 3 bottles of Ramazotti. 

* 6 1/3 oz Amaro Ramazzotti  
* 5 oz orange tincture*  
* 0.75 oz Stirrings Blood Orange bitters  
* 2 oz Mineral Water  


Place all ingredients into a container and stir. Allow ingredients to mix for at least a week then filter and bottle. 


*Orange tincture is half high proof vodka and half dried orange peel. Let them mingle in a jar for up to a month. Shaking daily can help speed up the process.


**Thanksgiving in Brooklyn**

For my Thanksgiving cocktail I am doing what I call Thanksgiving in Brooklyn, a Brooklyn Cocktail infused with the flavors of a Thanksgiving turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing and gravy! All jesting aside, this cocktail is actually infused with some of the sweet flavors of a Thanksgiving dinner. Made with baked spiced apple infused rye, muddled fresh cranberries, and stirred with spiced pumpkin puree. It is really a nice spin on this cocktail for the holiday. 


To make the infused rye, grind up 4 allspice berries, 1 stick of cassia cinnamon, 1 stick of ceylon cinnamon, and 4 cloves in a morter. Then sprinkle along with ½ cup of brown sugar on 4 apple halves. I then topped with a quick grating of nutmeg. Bake for 1-1.5 hrs at 350 degrees. Add the baked apples to 12oz of rye and let infuse for 1-2 days, then strain and filter.


To make the spiced pumpkin puree, roast the meat of a pumpkin, sprinkled with cinnamon, star anise, honey, and clove at 400 for about 30 minutes or until soft and caramelized. Then blend on high in a food processor.


For the cocktail, I muddle a few cranberries in the bottom of a mixing glass; add a teaspoon of pumpkin puree, ice, and the remaining ingredients +1/4 oz extra infused rye. The extra rye helps balance some of the additional sweetness. Stir, strain, and server with a thanksgiving turkey or pie. A Thanksgiving in Brooklyn is full of spicy sweetness with the added tartness from the cranberries.


**Cheers!**

I hope you enjoyed this week’s cocktail. Much like my last post on the Remember the Maine cocktail, this cocktail is very similar to a Manhattan, yet so much more than a variation. The Brooklyn is a dry Manhattan with the subtle sweetness of maraschino and orange amer. For those of us in the US, I hope you’ll enjoy one over the holiday weekend. And everyone outside the US should call in sick and enjoy a Brooklyn anyways. 


If you’ve had original Amer Picon chime in and let us know how it stacks up to the substitutes. If you’ve made Amer Boudreau let me know how it came it! If you have not made some, give it a shot; I cannot wait to try mine when it’s done. Feel free to comment on any other amari you have tried that worked well in this cocktail. The absence of Amer Picon has long been an excuse to dismiss the Brooklyn Cocktail, but as substitutes and craft recreations are becoming more refined, I hope you will give this drink a try.


As a final reminder /u/hebug’s [Not Cocktail of the Week Book](https://redditmade.com/campaign/not-cocktail-of-the-week-book) Redditmade campaign is ending in only 2 days, if you haven’t already go back it. Don’t ask, just do it. Until next week, have a safe and happy holiday.
