First off, I want to thank /u/hebug for giving me the opportunity to write up a NCotW post.  I feel the provenance of a cocktail is just as important as its ingredients, and his posts provide both.  It’s that kind of quality that makes this sub so great.

**Not Cocktail of the Week #91: Algonquin**

The Algonquin probably shouldn’t be as persistent of a cocktail as it is.  Composed of only three ingredients – rye, pineapple juice, and dry vermouth – it lacks depth and bite.  Yet, it’s featured in Ted Haigh’s Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails and there is no shortage of websites banging out the same recipe and quips from Dorothy Parker.  How can a lackluster drink cause such a stir?

**Background**

The Algonquin is named after the famed hotel in New York City, once a refuge for the struggling writer and a secondary home for the quirky and creative.  Traveling authors would be treated to a night for free in exchange for an autographed book, and the owner of the hotel would feed the young and hungry writers of New York with celery and popovers at their very own round table.  This group became known as the Algonquin Round Table but preferred to call themselves the Vicious Circle.  Composed of journalists, authors, publicists and actors, they gathered for lunch in the Algonquin’s dining room throughout the 20’s to exchange wit and barbs.  In spite of Prohibition, the group drank heavily, though probably at nearby speakeasies.  In addition to their literary contributions, like founding the New Yorker magazine, they managed to wax lyrically about alcohol:


“I know I’m drinking myself to a slow death, but then I’m in no hurry.”
- Robert Benchley

 
  There is no evidence they ever drank Algonquin cocktails at the Algonquin Hotel, not quite the right fit for the martini and highball crowd.  This drink was most likely made in tribute to the merriment and banter that echoed through that hallowed dining room.  And that’s where it should have stayed, a half-baked, late night, what-can-we-make-with-what-we-have? moment.  Except the specter of those glory days was probably too much to leave in the past.

I always saw the Algonquin as the counterpart to the Mary Pickford cocktail, the Algonquin spiked with rye invented by intellectuals in New York and the other, rum-laden in the Caribbean for jet setters.  Both are out of balance, lack any notable flavor, aside from pineapple, yet have persevered.  They are victims of circumstance, poorly constructed, but commemorate the best of times.  And there is the hidden ingredient that really shines thru in the Algonquin, context.  Why are bar patrons constantly ordering Manhattans, Martinis, Pisco Sours, Cosmos, or Negronis, regardless of the choices presented on the menu before them?  The associations attached to those cocktails are so pleasing, they can’t help but order them over and over, resupplying themselves with whatever memory or feeling it touches on.  The Industry Sour from the NCotW post a couple weeks back is the perfect example of a cocktail befitting of our times; given its name and with the right ingredients, it has staying power.  Not to mention it’s tasty. 

**Recipes**

From *Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails*, Ted Haigh, 2009

* 1.5oz Rye
* .75oz Dry Vermouth
* .75oz Pineapple Juice
* Shake, strain, serve up.

From *The PDT Cocktail Book*, 2011, adapted from G. Selmer Fougner’s Along The Wine Trail, 1935

* 2oz Rittenhouse Rye
* .75oz Noilly Prat Dry Vermouth
* .75oz Pineapple Juice, preferably fresh
* Shake, strain, serve up.
* Garnish with a pineapple leaf.

**Results**

If you read other write ups of the Algonquin, you’ll find a near unanimous ‘meh’ from its imbibers.  The rye is right in front, big and bulbous, then some flabby juice lacking any real zip. The vermouth is completely lost.  I tried adding a squeeze of lemon and a dash of orange bitters to save it, but, alas, it wasn’t possible and down the drain it went.

But we must keep the spirit alive!  I was lucky enough to work with a few of the guys and gals from Bar Agricole for a series of pop-ups years back.  If you don’t know their M.O., they whittle drinks down to the driest they can be without losing flavor.  This recipe was developed for those events.

**Variations**

(The Spirit of the) Algonquin

* 2oz 90 proof rye, preferably Sazerac Rye
* .75oz lemon juice
* .75oz Small Hand Foods pineapple gum
* .5oz Dolin Blanc
* 1 dash orange bitters

The rye is very much upfront but the other flavors mingle in the background to give a dry tiki feel, with notes of golden raisin, apple and apricot. I highly recommend Sazerac Rye but it’s hard to come by these days. I resorted to using Russell’s Reserve 6yr rye for this write up and would go lower in proof before I went higher – Rittenhouse Rye is too much.  Whiskey sours typically go one of two ways, playing off the high tones of the lemon or relying on darker fruit notes utilizing grenadine or red wine.  This variation slides right between those two poles.

Add a couple dashes of peach bitters and the drink becomes a Queen Anne, as per Ted Haigh. He seems to be the only reference to that drink.  Didn’t have any peach bitters nearby to give it a go. Maybe someone could report back.

**Blanc Vermouth**

Dolin Blanc is a vermouth from Chambery, France. Dolin first invented and popularized the style in 1821, a sweet vermouth from white wine with softer herbs and less spice than a classic sweet vermouth. There are others, like Perucchi and Martini Bianco, but I find the Dolin to be a shade subtler, which I like in this drink, considering the original Algonquin called for dry vermouth.

**Pineapple Gum**

Pineapple gum might be an ingredient not everyone is familiar with.  Essentially, it’s a simple syrup infused with pineapple to which gum arabic is added. The gum arabic works as a preservative and adds body to the drink.  I find it is the closest I can get to fresh pineapple flavor without juicing a pineapple.

**In Summary**

While the Algonquin might not be the most carefully constructed cocktail, it deserves its place in the annals of cocktail culture due to its associations of artists and scofflaws.
