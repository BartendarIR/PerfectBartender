**Not Cocktail of the Week #52: Old-Fashioned**  
Well here we are at the beginning of a new year and the completion of the first year “Not Cocktail of the Week”. In light of this momentous occasion, I thought this would be a good opportunity to tackle one of the most venerated and well-known cocktails of all, the Old-Fashioned. So buckle up for a serious history lesson, an exploration of the proper methodology, and an extensive collection of recipes.
 
**Background**  
To start off, I have to say that the vast majority of this research was courtesy of David Wondrich, who has done an amazing job with his book delving into the history of cocktails, *Imbibe!*. If you want a more thorough story into the origins of the Old-Fashioned and many other cocktails or particularly enjoy the historical section of NCotW, consider picking up a copy yourself. He does a much better job than I ever could.  
In order to understand the history of the Old-Fashioned, or the original Cocktail/Cock-tail/Cock tail, we first must start with the origin of bitters. While herbal tinctures and remedies have been around for millennia, it was not until the early 1700s when they began being mixed with alcohol. The earliest and best recorded occurrence of this comes to us from London in 1690 when Richard Stoughton, an apothecary in London, concocted “Elixir Magnum Stomachicum” aka “Stoughton’s Great Cordial Elixir”, comprised of 22 different botanicals. One of the popular drinks of this time was the Purl-Royal, made by fortifying a sweet sherry base with brandy and infusing it with botanicals, or what we would recognize today as vermouth. Richard Stoughton’s concoction allowed people to make a much more palatable and consistent Purl-Royal while also saving them a great deal of time and effort.
It seems odd to me that, despite Europeans mixing what was essentially vermouth with some form of bitters, nobody thought of adding some gin to the mix, which would result in a Martinez. I guess it just they were missing the adventurous spirit and ingenuity that Americans applied to drinking. Americans had plentiful access to spirits, cheap sugar, clean water, and perhaps most importantly, a powerful thirst. While Stoughton’s “Elixir” was available in America, the do-it-yourself attitude combined with easy access to a vast array of natural herbs and botanicals in their backyard resulted in a wide array of medicinal “Bitters”, whether they be counterfeits, knock-offs, or original concoctions. Combined with an attitude that can be summed up as, “If it’s worth doing, it’s worth overdoing,” Americans figured that if a tsp of Bitters is good for you, surely a dram must be even better, especially as an eye-opener.  
In 1788, the *Pennsylvania Gazette* published a list of American drinks which included the Toddy, Grog, Sling, and Bitters, but was notably lacking any mention of the Cocktail. According to David Wondrich, the first formal mention of the Cocktail was found published in the *Farmer’s Cabinet* newspaper out of Amherst, New Hampshire in 1803. However, there is no definition or clarification as to what it was comprised of, so instead the best reference formally defining a Cocktail is found in the May 6, 1806 edition of the anti-Democrat political paper *Balance and Columbian Repository* published out of Hudson, New York. In it, a certain Harry Crosswell teases the local Democratic party for losing a local mayoral election by submitting a fictitious expense/profit ledger showing “Nothing”  under gains and “411 glasses Bitters, 25 Cock-tails” under losses. A follow-up question by a reader asking what a cock-tail is resulted in a response that provides the first formal definition of a cock-tail as thus:  
>“Cock tail, then, is a stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and bitters – it is vulgarly called bittered sling, and it is supposed to be an excellent electioneering potion, inasmuch as it renders the heart stout and bold, at the same time that it fuddles the head. It is said also, to be of great use to a democratic candidate: because, a person having swallowed a glass of it, is ready to swallow anything else.”  
 
While venerated today as one of the great classics, the Cocktail was originally considered more of a “frat boy” drink akin to today’s vodka and Red Bull, not something enjoyed in pleasant or proper company. The Cocktail combined two of the popular drinks of the time, the dram of Bitters and the Sling, which is why Crosswell refers to it as a “bittered sling”. I guess around that time someone figured that combining the two would result in something that both tasted great and could be justified as healthy for you.
Following its initial creation somewhere in the triangle between Boston, Albany, and New York City, many references to the Cocktail begin springing up in literature and newspapers of the 1820s. While still considered somewhat of a vulgar drink by some, the Cocktail continued to grow in popularity and slowly shifting away from its original recipe as a “bittered sling”. By the 1850s, the Cocktail had become standardized as being served cold and with this came the introduction of syrups into the Cocktail as lump sugar did not dissolve very well in cold liquor. This resulted in the Cocktail subtly but steadily changing, as can be seen in such things as the [Improved Whiskey Cocktail](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1hkxy5/not_cocktail_of_the_week_26_improved_whiskey/) which incorporates of maraschino liqueur. By the time Jerry Thomas got around to penning *How to Mix Drinks* in 1863, he included 13 different cocktails, which grew to 23 by 1887 and only continued to grow from there.
Of course, there were those who resisted this branching out and change of the Cocktail into the menagerie of drinks that we colloquially refer to as cocktails today and it was those that insisted on things being done the old fashioned way that resulted in the Old-Fashioned cocktail. The Old-Fashioned is first mentioned in an 1880 edition of the *Chicago Tribune* and two years later defined as “…made of loaf-sugar and whisky…” By 1895, George Kappeler included it in *Modern American Drinks* and the 1850 version of the Cocktail was renamed the Old-Fashioned. Yet despite this drink being a direct backlash to the addition of orgeat, curacao, absinthe, and vermouth to the original Cocktail, the Old-Fashioned continued to bear an assault upon its description as even as early as 1916, people were already adding oranges, pineapple, curacao, absinthe, and the like again. This is completely against the original spirit of the drink, which conveniently segues into the next section on the proper methodology of an Old-Fashioned.
