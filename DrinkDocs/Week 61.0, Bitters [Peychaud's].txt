**Not Cocktail of the Week #61: Sazerac**  
Happy Fat Tuesday! This week’s NCotW comes a day early so that we can celebrate Mardi Gras with arguably the most famous and well-known New Orleans cocktail, the Sazerac. Last year I tackled the [Ramos Gin Fizz](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/18c2wl/not_cocktail_of_the_week_6_special_mardi_gras/) for Mardi Gras, but I’m definitely overdue for visiting the Sazerac, so for this year’s Mardi Gras Special Edition, I’ll be sharing about the Sazerac.  

**Background**  	
As a venerated classic cocktail, the origin story of the Sazerac must have some thorny contentious issues as David Wondrich actually elects *not* to go into the background story in interests of length for his book *Imbibe!*. While he elects not to dive into the history of its creation, in my research, most of the tales seem to converge on a reasonably coherent story. The Sazerac cocktail would not exist without Peychaud’s bitters and their creator, an apothecary named Antoine Amédée Peychaud, was apparently serving “medicinal” drinks comprised of brandy, sugar, and his specially formulated bitters in the 1830s (note this is well past the first mention of the cocktail, found in 1806, see the NCotW on the [Old-Fashioned](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1u7nb3/not_cocktail_of_the_week_52_oldfashioned/) for more). This concoction gained popularity and was eventually served at the Merchants Exchange Coffee House (perhaps akin to the “coffee shops” of Amsterdam?) which specifically used Sazerac-de-Forge et Fils Cognac as its base spirit. In 1859, John Schiller acquired the Merchants Exchange Coffee House, renaming it to the Sazerac Coffee House and between the use of Sazerac Cognac and being served at the Sazerac Coffee House that this cocktail received its name. According to Stanley Clisby Arthur, author of the 1937 *Famous New Orleans Drinks and How to Mix ‘Em*, at some point in the following decade, Leon Lamothe, a bartender at the Sazerac Coffee House, thought to add the trendy dash of absinthe. Unfortunately, starting in the in the 1860s, Europe’s vineyards were decimated by the phylloxera plague, which severely curtailed the availability of Cognac for the original Sazerac. It was around this time that the Sazerac that we know today finally took shape, as a Thomas (John?) H. Handy, a new owner of the Sazerac Coffee House, changed the base spirit from Cognac to rye whiskey. Yet curiously, there exists bottled versions of the “Sazerac Cocktail, prepared and bottled by Thomas H. Handy”, which date to June 30, 1906, utilizing the original Sazerac-de-Forge et Fils Cognac which originally gave this cocktail its name. Perhaps it is a relic of a bygone era using a personal stash? In any case, in 1933, the Sazerac was bottled and marketed by the Sazerac Company of New Orleans and has persisted as the “Official Cocktail of New Orleans” ever since.

Into a mixing glass full of cracked ice place about a small barspoonful of gum syrup, three drops of Selner bitters and a jigger of Sazerac brandy; stir well, strain into a stem cocktail-glass which has been rinsed out with a dash of absinthe, squeeze a piece of lemon peel over the top and serve with ice water on the side. 

*The Savoy Cocktail Book*, Harry Craddock, 1930

* 3 dashes Peychaud bitters  
* 2 to 2.5 oz whisky  
Stir with large ice cubes until thoroughly chilled. Empty the Old-Fashioned glasses. Put 1 dash absinthe in each glass and twirl glasses until inside is thoroughly rinsed with the absinthe, throwing out any excess liquid. Strain liquor into the chilled and rinsed glasses. Twist a strip of lemon peel over each drink and drop into glass for decoration. Serve with a glass of ice water on the side as a chaser.

**Results**  
I first tried the standard Sazerac using Rittenhouse rye, a generous barspoon of cane syrup, three dashes of Peychaud’s, and finished with a twist of lemon over the top in an Absente-rinsed glass. This started off by filling my nose with the notes of lemon oil, the musky pepperiness of Peychaud’s bitters, and a hint of sweet anise. When it first passed my lips, I was surprised by how light and subtle it was on the palate at first, with a brief sweetness and a hint of lemon aromatics. As the flavor developed, it became much more robust, going to the familiar spicy and fruity profile of a good rye whiskey, both notes amplified by the Peychaud’s, with the absinthe pushing the fruity flavors a bit forward. The finish is clearly of rye whiskey and I concluded that the Sazerac is *the* best way to showcase a good rye whiskey, analogous to how an Old-Fashioned does for bourbon.  
After the delicious and strong rye whiskey Sazerac, I felt emboldened and curious as to what the possibly more historically accurate Cognac-based version would taste like, so I did an identical recipe except using some Remy Martin VSOP. This was immediately different from the rye Sazerac in the nose, which, while still having lemon, finds it meshing closerly with the fruitiness of cognac and brought forward by a more apparent anise note with the Peychaud’s playing a backup role here. Again, I was surprised by how initially light this was on my palate, in this case the initial note being a slight pepperiness from the Peychaud’s bitters. I’ve never had anything combining Cognac and Peychaud’s before, but I found the combination unexpectedly pleasant, both serving to temper each other, with neither the fruit or pepper notes overwhelming the drink. On the finish, the Cognac fades leaving behind a mild bitterness from the Peychaud’s. I found this version to be very distinct from the rye Sazerac, this one being a much subtler and smoother experience compared to the bold flavor profile of rye whiskey. If you’ve become accustomed to the rye Sazerac, I would encourage you to give it a shot with Cognac, it’s definitely a unique experience and I can see times when I might actually prefer sipping on this.

**Peychaud’s Bitters**  
I have previously written a bit on Peychaud’s bitters in my post on the [Vieux Carré](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1a8cs5/not_cocktail_of_the_week_10_vieux_carr%C3%A9/), another New Orleans classic, so go there if you want to know more.

**Cheers!**  
Hope you all have a safe time celebrating Mardi Gras wherever you are. As for myself, I’ll probably be quietly savoring a Sazerac. Feel free to chime in if you enjoy the Sazerac in some other unique way, or alternatively if you think I’m doing it wrong. As usual, your questions and feedback are welcome in the comments below. I’ll be back next week with another classic cocktail, but until then dear readers, cheers!
