**Not Cocktail of the Week #27: Daiquiri**  
As astutely pointed out by /u/viress [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1hlrap/not_not_cocktail_of_the_week_rum/), I have not done my due diligence in featuring cocktails utilizing rum. This is mostly due to my favorite spirits being gin and whiskey, but is also partly due to my relative unfamiliarity with rum itself. In order to remedy this, I’m going to take a couple weeks to write up some classic rum-based cocktails, going back to their classic roots, and giving them the respect they deserve. To start off, this week I am presenting the classic Daiquiri cocktail, a remarkably refreshing drink that is undergoing a surge in popularity. Hopefully this article will help everyone avoid the overly sweetened, artificially flavored, ice blended version and introduce you to the wonders of a classic Daiquiri. Oh and by the way, July 19th is National Daiquiri Day, so read ahead to prepare yourself and enjoy one next week!

**Background**  
The Daiquiri is a classic cocktail that, for once, has a clearly documented history with David Wondrich calling it “the first true classic cocktail to be invented outside the United States”. The Daiquiri originated in Cuba and is named after either (or both) Playa Daiquiri, a beach near Santiago, Cuba, or the small town of Daiquiri that lies nearby. The creation of this drink is undisputedly credited to Jennings Stockton Cox, an American mining engineer working abroad in Cuba during the Spanish-American War. Legend has it that Mr. Cox either (or both!) created the Daiquiri with the few ingredients he had on hand (rum, lime, and sugar), or that he concocted it as a way to serve rum to American guests after he ran out of gin. Either way, the original recipe was documented in Mr. Cox in his personal diary and it serves as a clear reminder to write down your recipes. As Adam Savage of Mythbusters often quotes, “The only difference between science and screwing around is writing it down.”  
The Daiquiri languished in Cuba as a local drink until 1909, when Admiral Lucius Johnson, an officer in the Navy, brought it with him back to the US, introducing it to the Army and Navy Club (the convenient origin of the eponymous Army and Navy cocktail), where its popularity rapidly increased in Washington, D.C. It quickly became a favorite cocktail of both Ernest Hemingway (who had his favored variation with grapefruit juice and maraschino liqueur) and President John F. Kennedy. The Daiquiri’s popularity increased even further in the 1940s due to a combination of a whiskey shortage due to wartime rationing, readily availability of rum thanks to Roosevelt’s “Good Neighbor Program”, and a fascination with Latin American culture. It was in this era that David Embury wrote about the Daiquiri as one of his 6 basic drinks in *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*, going so far as to say that he considers it a “vastly superior cocktail to the Manhattan”, but ultimately isn’t as popular due to the use of inferior rum (referring specifically to how Cuban rum is much better than the more common Puerto Rican rum) and improper proportions (he is a rather opinionated person).  
The Daiquiri is recently undergoing a bit of a renaissance in terms of its popularity amongst bartenders, who consider the Daiquiri, alongside the Old-Fashioned and the Manhattan, as a way to judge the quality of a cocktail bar. The simplicity of these drinks can speak volumes in terms of the thoughtful choice of spirit, the care in preparing it, and subsequently the personality of the bartender itself. That and on a hot humid summer day, ordering a crisp and sour Daiquiri can be a lot more appealing than a bitter and complex Manhattan.

**Results**  
It is most important to use a good white rum, David Wondrich suggests Havana Club 3-year if possible, though illegal to smuggle into the US. Given this fact he instead suggests the Nicaraguan Flor de Cana 4-year Extra Dry or the Trinidadian 10 Cane Rum. I have heard good things about Denizen rum, a blend of Trinidadian and Jamaican rums, going well in a Daiquiri.  
As can be seen in the evolution of the Daiquiri over the last century, it has slowly progressed towards a less spirit-dominated drink, and closer to the general recipe for a sour cocktail. My tasting notes are for the 8:4:3 ratio, a respectable (I actually just heard it mentioned on The Speakeasy Podcast hosted by Damon Boelte and featuring guest Abraham Hawkins of Dutch Kills [here](http://www.heritageradionetwork.com/episodes/4360-The-Speakeasy-Episode-98-Abraham-Hawkins)) and well-balanced ratio, letting each ingredient speak their turn while being a harmonious cocktail. There is not much in the nose of this cocktail, as the exceptional coldness mutes most of the volatiles, so I only detected a very light nose of rum. In the mouth, I first note the bitter acidity of lime mixing with the unique slight funkiness and vegetal notes of rum, transitioning to a sweet and bright sour combination, and finishing dry and slightly puckering. The finish caused a notable involuntary salivation and desire for either some delicious food or another sip. This is a bright and refreshing cocktail great for quaffing on a hot summer day (in San Francisco what a joke) and given its simplicity, easy to make a big batch of and share with friends.

**Variations**  
There are a ton of variations on the classic Daiquiri that don’t even come close to requiring any sort of blender, the first of which are the many different ratios of rum:lime juice:simple syrup. The recipe I gravitate to is 8:4:3, while Difford’s Guide goes with a slightly drier 10:3:2 (also conveniently the current flair of /u/ClamydiaDellArte), the International Bartenders’ Association a tart 9:4:1, and David Embury a spirit-dominated 8:2:1. This is largely dependent on your personal taste, but can also depend on the individual characteristics of the white rum used. Feel free to start with any of those ratios depending on how you know you enjoy your drinks and then adjust from there.  
In addition to the standard Daiquiri, there are some established variations, imaginatively called Daiquiri #2 (+orange juice), Daiquiri #3 aka the Hemingway Daiquiri (+maraschino liqueur/grapefruit juice), Daiquiri #4 (+maraschino liqueur), Daiquiri #5 (+maraschino liqueur/grenadine), and presumably the list goes on. The addition of maraschino is quite common adding an interesting woodsy note on the finish and a smoother characteristic, so if you have that at home, give it a shot. Additionally, David Wondrich suggests some variation can also be had by using orgeat (an almond syrup which I will hopefully write about next week), or falernum (can I consider this a spiced orgeat?), which both feature prominently in Caribbean drinks, as a sweetener.  

**White Rum**  
Much as with last week’s post, this one’s history ran long leaving me short on both time and character limit to go into white rum. My research and education on this subject will have to wait until the next NCotW featuring white rum. Sorry about that. 

**Cheers!**  
Thanks to everyone who has read through this lengthy write-up, hopefully you’ve enjoyed it and learned something in the process. Please feel free to post in the comments how you enjoy your Daiquiri, and if you are motivated, share a picture of your results. Any suggestions for future rum NCotW posts, critiques on my write-ups, opinions/questions about the Daiquiri cocktail, or anything that strikes your fancy is appreciated. Your gestures of appreciation are always appreciated, though rather than reddit gold, for now any of the cocktail books on my Amazon cocktail wishlist [here](http://amzn.com/w/LJIN08K4RTJW) will be put to good use in my research and education, or alternatively there were a few items from Cocktail Kingdom I couldn’t afford to get for my upcoming birthday, so contact me if you’re interested. Thanks again for reading this week’s column and cheers!
