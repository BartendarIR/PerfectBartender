So I was kindly allowed to write a guest post for this week's NCOTW

**History**


The origins of the White Lady are somewhat hazy. There are two popular stories of how this classic cocktail came to be. 


The first dates back to 1919, where Harry MacElhone created the first White Lady, originally a sickly sweet concoction of 4 parts Cointreau, one part creme de menthe, and one part lemon juice. However, at some point in the ten years afterwards, at Harry’s New York Bar in Paris, the cocktail had been altered to resemble the more modern White Lady. The creme de menthe had been switched for gin, the up and coming spirit at the time, the amount of Cointreau halved, and an egg white added.

In the second story, it is claimed that the White Lady was created by Harry Craddock, of the Savoy Cocktail Bar of Westminster. He was given credit as the creator in the Savoy Cocktail Book, published in 1930. The former head barman of the Savoy, Joe Gilmore, said the White Lady was the cocktail of choice of the comedy double act Laurel and Hardy.


**Recipe**


As with almost any cocktail, there are going to be some discrepancies in the proportions of the ingredients. However, the main area of debate surrounding the White Lady’s recipe is the inclusion of egg whites. 

The egg white is added to alter the consistency of the drink. It gives the drink a mouthfeel that could be described as silky, with a small layer of foam on top. If egg whites are added to any drink, it is important to also have a strong citrus part to the cocktail as well. This is to “cook” the egg white, and make it safer to drink. Also, with any drink containing egg whites, give it a dry shake first. By this I mean shake it without ice first, then again with. Some people like to add the spring from a hawthorne strainer at this point. The drink should then be shaken normally, with ice. Make sure you hold both ends of the shaker firmly! The egg whites expand slightly, making the shaker easier to pop open, so watch out for that.

The most common proportions used are:

2 parts gin


1 part Cointreau


1 part lemon juice


1 egg white (optional)



Shaken over ice, and strained into a chilled cocktail glass.

I personally like to add 2 dashes of orange bitters, although I can’t find that included in any recipes. 


**Results**


The first thing I notice when I lift it to take a sip is the strong smell of the lemon, along with the egg whites and the orange bitters. It’s hard to describe, but it’s almost as if it wants you to stick your nose in further and really breathe it in.

The egg whites give it that silky smooth texture, which is the first thing you pick up on when you drink it. Almost immediately afterwards, you get hit with the sourness of the lemons, with the herbal notes in the gin becoming more prominent as the taste fades. The sweetness of the Cointreau is there throughout.

I’d say this is a very balanced cocktail, in that neither the sourness, the sweetness or the strength of the alcohol overpower one another. It’s also quite a light and easy going cocktail. If you have anyone that you want to ease gently into higher quality cocktails, then I would recommend this one over something stronger, like an old fashioned. 


**Variations**

The whole idea of strong:sweet:sour is so prevalent that I wouldn’t class these as variations: more like belonging to a family of drinks. Namely, sours.

Take 2 parts of something strong, one part of something sour, and one part of something sweet. Add these together and whatever combination, chances are it will taste alright. Many of the world’s most famous cocktails belong to the sours family. Tequila, triple sec and lime gets you a margarita. Brandy, Cointreau, lemon and simple syrup makes a sidecar. The list is seemingly endless.


This is useful as a base for discovering and creating new drinks, so feel free to experiment a bit!



I've had a great time writing this post, and hopefully it's something I could do again in the future. Cheers
