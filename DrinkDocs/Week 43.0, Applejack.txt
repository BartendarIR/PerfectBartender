**Not Cocktail of the Week #43: Diamondback**  
For this week’s NCotW, I want to share the Diamondback cocktail, another classic cocktail whose name may be a fitting start to your Halloween festivities. I should have planned to do Satan’s Whiskers since that is my Halloween drink of choice, but Halloween just snuck up on me. As a bonus, check out the Satan’s Whiskers write-up from 12bottlebar [here](http://12bottlebar.com/2010/10/satan%E2%80%99s-whiskers/) as this is where I first learned of it. In any case, let’s move on and take a bite of the Diamondback cocktail.

**Background**  
The Diamondback cocktail was originally published in *Bottoms Up* by Ted Saucier in 1951. Similar to the Last Word, the Diamondback is another cocktail that Murray Stenson, famed bartender at Zig Zag Cafe in Seattle, rediscovered and popularized. Though the original recipe calls for yellow chartreuse, Murray Stenson felt that the stronger flavors of green chartreuse would complement the robust rye whiskey better, and so these days a Diamondback is almost always made with green chartreuse. Though one would assume this cocktail was named after the Diamondback rattlesnake (and rightfully so given that it is comprised of a full 3 oz of 100+ proof spirits, giving it a rather venomous bite), it is actually named after the Diamondback Lounge in the Lord Baltimore Hotel, which itself may be named after the Diamondback terrapin, the state reptile of Maryland and mascot of the University of Maryland. 

**Recipes**

*its sweet venom fills my mouth*  
*leaving me bitter*   
Well this is certainly a strong cocktail that will warm you up on a cold day with its use of 100 proof rye whiskey, 100 proof apple brandy, and 110 proof green chartreuse. This cocktail smelled absolutely delicious in the glass while stirring, filling the air with its sweet, fruity, and herbal nose enough that my wife commented how great it smelled when she walked by. I also got a hint of something that reminded me of cotton candy, but that could just be me. It is quite thick-textured on the palate, partly due to the high proof of the resulting cocktail, but also due to the thickness imparted by green chartreuse. I first get the complex herbal sweetness of green chartreuse, combining briefly with the apple character from the brandy and finishing with the spiciness of rye with the bitter botanicals of chartreuse. I garnished it with two cherries, one soaked in rye whiskey and one in spiced rum with additional cinnamon chips, which both really amplified the different spicy characteristics of the drink. It takes a little longer to really start to appreciate the flavors of this cocktail as its higher alcohol content can initially numb the palate, so take your time enjoying it.  

**Cheers!**  
This is a great cocktail to sip and savor as the weather changes, the temperature starts to cool, and you find yourself craving something strong, potent, and brown. Hopefully some of you will be able to try this cocktail, though do be cognizant of its strength. As always, your comments and feedback are appreciated below; and if you have a cocktail you’d like to contribute to this regular series, drop me a line. Cheers and Happy Halloween!
