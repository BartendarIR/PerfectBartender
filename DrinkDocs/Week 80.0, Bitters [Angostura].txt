**Not Cocktail of the Week #80: Mojito**  
It’s all too easy to forget that for most people, summer is in full swing. Here in San Francisco, summer is mostly a depressing joke with high temperatures in the mid-60s (~18°C), worse even than my rainy hometown, Seattle. Regardless, summer drinks are on the menu for NCotW and this week I wanted to tackle a very popular drink, the Mojito. While it is oft-maligned either for being made sloppily or for requiring too much work to do properly, it is a very nice drink and a definite crowd pleaser when made well.  

**Background**  
Legend has it (or Bacardi’s marketing department) that the roots of the Mojito can be traced to the explorer Sir Francis Drake’s visit to Havana, Cuba in the 1500s. One of his associates, Richard Drake, is said to have combined the local spirit aquardiente (a crude form of rum made with a wide variety of fermentables) with lime, sugar, and mint, calling the resulting drink the El Draque or “The Drake”. In 1940, the Cuban playwright and poet Federico Villoch was quoted as saying “When aquardiente was replaced with rum, the Draque was to be called a Mojito.” There are alternate stories that it was invented by African slaves working the sugar cane fields, though exactly how and when they would be able to distill spirits and enjoy a cocktail seems dubious to me.  
More feasibly, the Mojito as we know it was likely invented sometime between 1850 and 1920, which coincides with the first shipments of ice and advent of charged water in Cuba, though an exact date for this cocktail is not recorded. David Wondrich’s research seems to support that rough date range as he attributes its creation to be after Don Facundo Bacardi first set up shop in 1862, but before his earliest recorded reference in 1931 from a bar pamphlet from “Sloppy Joe’s Bar” in Havana. *The PDT Cocktail Book* references a recipe slightly earlier titled the Mojo de Ron from the 1929 *Libro de Cocktail* by Juan A. Lasa, though I have no idea what that recipe actually looks like.  
The Mojito seems to have a regular waxing and waning in popularity with a ~30 year cycle as after its inception, it again became popular in the 1940s, near the end of Prohibition as people with means fled to Cuba for their drinks. At this time, the Mojito was further popularized by the great writer Ernest Hemingway who was drinking his Mojitos at La Bodeguita del Medio. It then experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1970s, as it was reported to me by the “5 Minutes of Rum” podcast which credits the book *And A Bottle of Rum* by Wayne Curtis. Most recently, the Mojito became popularized by James Bond, as portrayed by Pierce Brosnan, in the 2002 movie “Die Another Day”, where James Bond orders one for a female love interest.

* 1.5 oz Bacardi Silver rum  
* 2 dashes of Angostura bitters (optional)  
* Soda water  
Muddle one mint sprig with the simple syrup and lime juice in the bottom of a mixing glass. Add the rest of the ingredients and shake with ice. Strain over cracked ice into a highball glass, top with soda, and garnish with the remaining sprig of mint.  

*The Joy of Mixology*, Gary Regan, 2003  
* 4 lime wedges  
* 2 to 3 teaspoons granulated sugar  
* 8 to 10 fresh mint leaves  
* 2 oz light rum  
* Club soda  
* 2 or 3 mint sprigs, for garnish  
Muddle the lime wedges, sugar, and mint leaves in a mixing glass until the sugar is completely dissolved, all the juice is extracted from the limes, and the mint is thoroughly integrated into the juice. Add ice and the rum to the mixing glass, shake briefly, and strain into a Collins glass filled with crushed ice. Top with club soda, and add the garnish.

**Results**  
There is a lot of variation in every Mojito recipe and no real consensus on any single historically accurate recipe, but I feel there generally seem to be two different styles of Mojito, one that is shaken and served strained, the other that is built and served long. One important common theme is to not muddle the life out of the mint and shred it into tiny bits as that releases the bitter chlorophyll notes into your drink. I made both versions, working with somewhat hybrid recipes of each style.  
I first made a version that I drew from *The PDT Cocktail Book* and the Bartender’s Choice app. I combined the general ratio I enjoy from Bartender’s choice of 2 oz Flor de Cana white rum, 1 oz lime juice, and 0.75 oz simple cane sugar syrup, with the general method from PDT (particularly their specific measure of soda water which I appreciate). I’ve always worked under the assumption that if shaken, there’s really no point to muddling the mint as the violent action of shaking with ice will do that job for you. After shaking, it is then fine strained onto fresh ice and garnished with some slapped mint. This version was light and bracing with the crisp vegetal aroma of mint combining with sugary rum and a hint of lime in the nose. It has a light fizziness at the start which fades to reveal the familiarly pleasant balanced sweet and sour, some notable rum notes in the middle, and a cooling mint sensation on the finish with some lingering vegetal notes. This was very simple and tasty, though I felt it was very close to the [Daiquiri](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1i0sbt/not_cocktail_of_the_week_27_daiquiri/) with the added bonus mint flavor making it extra crisp.  
I then tried the more commonly encountered built version, pulling inspiration from Jeffrey Morgenthaler’s recipe (again I really appreciate exact measure for soda water) and *Joy of Mixology*, though with my own twists. For this version (and my current preferred Mojito recipe), I first muddled half a lime cut into quarters with 1 tbsp sugar. I knew from recent experience that my current limes yield a hair more than 1 oz juice, so this would result in ~0.5 oz of lime juice. The 1 tbsp measure of sugar is my approximation of how much sugar is in 0.75 oz (1.5 tbsp) simple syrup. I first muddled the lime wedges and sugar together dry, to abrade some of the oils in the lime peel as recommended in *Joy of Mixology*, then added 0.5 oz of lime juice to bring it to ~1 oz lime juice total. After stirring to dissolve the sugar, I then added a small handful of fresh mint leaves and lightly muddled to release their aroma. Finally, I added 2 oz of Flor de Cana white rum, crushed ice, stirred to chill, then added 3 oz of cold soda water and stirred briefly before serving. This version is visually very striking in the glass, with the whole mint leaves and lime wedges floating amongst the drink and for the first time, I was able to successfully get my glass to frost over thanks to the exceptional quick chilling power of crushed ice. The coldness of this Mojito plays particularly well with mint, making this version very light and refreshing. The larger fraction of soda water allows effervescence to persist across the palate as I drink it, partnered with some robust lime aromatics throughout. Again I get the sweet and tart notes up front though to a lesser degree, diluted by the additional soda water. I felt the rum was a bit lost in this version, playing more of a supportive role and only notable near the end where it combines with lime peel and vegetal notes of mint. This version was much more distinct from the previous version, but also a lot more work. Still, for a more interesting and unique drink, it seems worthwhile. Finally, I concluded that making double recipes of either of these versions would be wise as they go down exceptionally fast.
