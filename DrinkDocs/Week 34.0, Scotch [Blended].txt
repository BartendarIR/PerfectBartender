**Not Cocktail of the Week #34: Cameron’s Kick**  
I must admit that I’ve been suffering from a bit of cocktail block (cockblock?) these past couple weeks as I have been trying to find a good cocktail for this week’s NCotW featuring either 1) Green Chartreuse (it’s been a while since the last cocktail with it) or 2) one of my less commonly used spirits such as cognac, tequila or Scotch. After experimenting and trying a handful of cocktails, I finally feel like I found a gem this week in the Cameron’s Kick, an obscure but classic cocktail that I had never heard of before.

**Background**  
Nobody seems to know the origins of the Cameron’s Kick, though its name seems like there must have been a colorful story behind it, perhaps from a bartender named Cameron? In any case, the Cameron’s Kick is primarily referenced from Harry Craddock’s *Savoy Cocktail Book*, dating it as a pre-prohibition cocktail, but *The PDT Cocktail Book* has a reference to Harry McElhone’s *ABCs of Mixing Cocktails* from 1922, though I can’t verify this reference.  
This cocktail is notable for using two notoriously difficult ingredients to incorporate into cocktails, Scotch and Irish whiskey, doing an amazing job melding these two related, though distinct, spirits. It’s pretty amazing that someone was able to conceive of the Cameron’s Kick with such a unique combination of ingredients. Paul of “The Cocktail Chronicles” blog probably sums it up best with this quote:  
>Remember the old saw about how, if you took a million monkeys and gave them each a typewriter, they’d eventually come up with the works of Shakespeare? Well edit “typewriter” to read “cocktail shaker,” and stick the monkeys in a well-stocked bar, and the banana-addled mixologists would come up with a Cameron’s Kick in about the same amount of time it’d take that set of simian scribes to work their way around to *Titus Andronicus*. Along with other head-scratchers such as the Blood & Sand, the Floridita and the Last Word, the Cameron’s Kick has a distinctive air of the implausible about it.  

The Cameron’s Kick cocktail was rediscovered in 2006 by cocktail historian David Wondrich, who served it to the attendees of the annual Tales of the Cocktail convention and should take credit for reintroducing this cocktail to a new generation of bartenders.

**Results**  
I first came across this cocktail in my typical method of cocktail discovery, the Bartender’s Choice app, scrolling through their selection of drinks containing Scotch whiskey. Intrigued by the recipe, I was relieved upon sipping it to have finally found second delicious cocktail with Scotch to write about in NCotW (can you believe that I haven’t written about Scotch since my first NCotW?).   
The Bartender’s Choice version is a bit sweeter than the slightly more spirit-forward Savoy version, but both have similar flavor profiles. On the nose I detect the pleasant and fresh aroma of lemon combining with the light sweetness of almond. In the mouth this cocktail is full-bodied from the orgeat, which is also the flavor that first crosses my palate. After the sweet almond beginning, it transitions into the juicy tartness of lemon before finishing with the spirits’ contributions of a light sweetness and smokiness. A faint smoky characteristic lingers on the finish along with the bitter aspects of lemon oil. The larger contribution of whiskey in the Savoy version gives a longer and more distinct whiskey character, but largely the progression of flavor is similar.
 
**Variations**  
Though I don’t have any Islay Scotch whiskey, I’m planning on getting some as I think it would be amazing in this cocktail. Though the Cameron’s Kick cuts the Scotch with Irish whiskey, I really think the additional smoky character could add an interesting dimension and finish to this cocktail. I, along with at least [one other person](http://cold-glass.com/2013/06/20/scotch-and-irish-camerons-kick/), also think that a few dashes of absinthe would not go unappreciated in this cocktail, which is another twist I haven’t yet had the pleasure of trying. If anyone has the means to do this with a decent Islay Scotch whiskey, I’d be very interested in hearing how it turns out.

**Cheers!**  
Hope you’ve enjoyed my second ever Scotch whiskey-based cocktail written up in NCotW, as Scotch-based cocktails are definitely rare compared to other base spirits. This, along with the [Mai Tai](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1ii3l5/not_cocktail_of_the_week_28_mai_tai/) and the [Army and Navy](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1kfacw/i_made_too_much_orgeat_whats_the_quickest_way_to/cbodsfn) (first introduced to me by /u/LMoore916), are both great uses for orgeat. If you don’t have any orgeat, there is a conveniently timed post from /u/buffalo_slim on how to make your own [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1l0xra/super_simple_one_step_orgeat_recipe_with_almond/), so do it and enjoy this delicious cocktail. Though I have cocktails planned for the next couple of weeks, I am still hoping to find another cocktail featuring Green Chartreuse to write up in NCotW, so if you have any suggestions, please PM me. I will gladly give credit, collaborate, or welcome a guest contribution if you are so inspired. Otherwise, all your comments, suggestions, and questions are welcome. Until next week, cheers!
