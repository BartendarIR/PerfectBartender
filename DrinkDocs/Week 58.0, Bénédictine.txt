**Happy Valentine’s Day!**
 
/u/hebug and I would like to extend a very Happy Valentine’s Day to all /r/cocktails subscribers and readers alike! What better opportunity to explore one of the naughtier Prohibition-era cocktails. I very much appreciate the opportunity to present my second NCotW series guest post. Enjoy!
 
**Background**
 
There appear to be two probable origins when researching the earliest Between the Sheets (“BTS”) cocktail, however, both primarily agree to its fundamental purpose…Many claim that the BTS cocktail was created in the early 1930s by Harry MacElhone of Harry's New York Bar in Paris. However, others argue that the cocktail instead originated in the 1920s in London by Mr. Polly, manager of the Berkeley Hotel.  Given the cocktails striking similarity to the Sidecar, considered a popular choice at Harry’s during this time, one can understand why the majority of cocktail historians tend to associate the BTS cocktail to Mr. MacElhone. Charles Baker’s 1939 Gentleman’s Companion though attributes the Between the Sheets’ origins to Mr. Weber, declaring the BTS cocktail, “totally sound, and already quite famous throughout the Near East.” The earliest documented recipe that I was able to find though comes from Harry Craddock’s Savoy Cocktail Book, published in 1930.
 
**What’s in a name anyway?**
 
It is fairly obvious given the cocktails name that the intentions of such a drink were of the sexual nature. In fact, there seems to be no attempt to hide such intentions. The earliest recipes all present a mixture of high proof ingredients combined to produce a very sweet yet potent drink. Of course, everyone’s interpretations are their own, but I can see where this combination might present an opportunity to quickly alter your significant other’s inhibitions…

**Results**
 
As you can see by reading the various recipes, this cocktail takes some tinkering to get right. Since I recently acquired a copy of Savoy Cocktail Book, I thought this was the best place to start especially considering it is the earliest recorded recipe that I could find. I used [Savoystomp](http://savoystomp.com/2008/07/21/savoy-cocktail-volume/) to help translate the measurements into today’s terminology. For the lemon juice, I started with 1 barspoon. This resulted in a drink that was far too sweet for my preferences and obviously lacked balance. I added a 2nd barspoon of lemon juice to my next attempt and it was drastically improved! The nose is delicate. The citrus notes from the cointreau and lemon seem to take the forefront. On the palate the flavors are initially sweet followed by a bit of spiciness. The extra citrus does wonders fixing the balance. The finish is much more of a dry rum profile. I think I would prefer more noticeable brandy flavors. It is much stronger than a Sidecar but not quite as satisfying for me personally. If you are interested and willing, I definitely would encourage you to try various combinations until you find the one that best fits your palate and your ingredients. The brandy and rum chosen for this cocktail will absolutely play a big part in the final product and the measurements needed.

**In Closing**
 
Overall, I enjoyed exploring this drink. The name may be “playful” but there’s definitely some merit to this cocktail if you can find the right balance of ingredients. If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again…be careful though because a few of these can get you a solid buzz pretty quickly if you aren’t paying attention!
