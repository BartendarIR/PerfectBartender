**Not Cocktail of the Week #66: Deauville**  
While I actually had this post scheduled many weeks ago for the onset of fall, I couldn’t quite get the balance right at the time and as it’s been a while since I’ve done an applejack cocktail, I came across this old draft and thought it was time to dust it off and finish it up. So for this week’s NCotW, I want to share the Deauville cocktail, a strong and fruity pre-prohibition cocktail that I first served to great success at a Thanksgiving party a couple years ago. 

**Background**  
There doesn’t seem to be much recorded history about the Deauville cocktail, a tasty cocktail that hasn’t enjoyed much popularity. It is believed to been named after the town of Deauville in Northern France, where one of its original key ingredients, calvados, is made. It was first recorded in the classic *Savoy Cocktail Book* which dates it to pre-Prohibition, but other than that, there is little known. This is essentially a variation on a 2:1:1 Sidecar that switches out half of the brandy for apple brandy, though I did not have the experience to recognize this relationship when I first made it. 

**Recipes**  
*The Savoy Cocktail Book*, Harry Craddock, 1930

**Results**  
Other than David Embury’s oddball recipe, the Deauville cocktail is comprised of apple brandy, brandy (Cognac), triple sec (Cointreau), and lemon juice. I find that the recipe using equal parts of each to work rather well when working with Laird’s applejack, it needed some slight tweaking when using the 100 proof bonded Laird’s apple brandy. I noted when I first made a Deauville with applejack that it could potentially use a little less lemon, as it came out a bit too tart for my taste. I later acquired the apple brandy, which has a richer flavor and went with the Bartender’s Choice recipe, which uses less lemon juice and more Cointreau. Oddly, this version lost some of its intense fruit character, perhaps because the Cointreau was becoming a dominant note. I finally settled on simply using equal parts of 0.75 oz each except the lemon at 0.5 oz. I felt this was the most balanced version in terms of flavor. The Deauville really has a rich apple aroma with a note of lemon oil on the nose. In the mouth, it starts off lightly on the palate, with a sweet apple juice flavor combining with the pure orange flavors of Cointreau. The tartness of lemon kicks in next, providing a nice contrast with these sweet fruit flavors before returning to a rich apple bolstered by the warm notes of brandy. This cocktail is intensely fruity from front to back, filled with strong and assertive flavors. Not sure why I don’t have this more often, but I really should, especially now that I’ve found a recipe to my liking.

**Variations**  
This cocktail essentially straddles the line between a Sidecar and the Applecar, which is essentially a Sidecar made entirely with apple brandy. All are great cocktails, but I’m partial to a Deauville as it successfully brings the best of both worlds together. If you want to read more about the Sidecar, I wrote about it in an old NCotW post that you can access through [this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/19cmfw/not_cocktail_of_the_week_8_sidecar/).

**Applejack**  
Applejack is a unique and storied ingredient, playing an important role in US history, so if you want to read about applejack and the company that makes it, Laird’s, find it in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1lqice/not_cocktail_of_the_week_35_corpse_reviver_no_1/) NCotW post on another great classic using apple brandy, the Corpse Reviver No. 1.

**Cheers!**  
Life has been very chaotic for me recently, so apologies for the abbreviated post this week. Given my usual tendency to be a bit wordy, perhaps this is a good thing. In any case, if you have the ingredients, give this forgotten classic a try. I really enjoyed it and would love to what you think in the comments below. Next week should be an interesting cocktail contributed by /u/whaleodile, so I’ll be back here in two weeks. Until then dear readers, cheers!
