**Not Cocktail of the Week #64: Brass Rail**  
I’ve been ridiculously busy with work the past couple weeks, so I haven’t has as much time as I would like to put into this week’s post, but I still wanted to briefly share a cocktail I’ve had on my radar for some time, the Brass Rail.  

**Background**  
Tony Abou-Ganim, the self-titled “Modern Mixologist”, is well known for the Cable Car cocktail, which is basically a spiced rum Sidecar finished with a cinnamon sugar rim. I can’t quite recall where I first heard of his lesser-known original concoction, the Brass Rail, but I became intrigued by the lack of recipes and information about it. What is known is that it is inspired by his cousin Helen David, who regularly enjoyed a well-made B&B as a nightcap (nothing premixed for her), and named after her bar in Port Huron, Michigan that she worked at for an impressive seventy years. After cutting his teeth at her bar, Tony Abou-Ganim moved away to work in the cocktail meccas San Francisco and New York, became inspired by an encounter with Dale Degroff, and eventually struck gold overseeing the bar program at the Bellagio casino and hotel in Las Vegas. While there he revolutionized cocktails, helping bring craft cocktails to the masses. Most recently, he has penned a book that aims to bring justice to the oft maligned spirit in the cocktail world, vodka, but if you want to read more detail about his life and the role he’s had in the cocktail world, check out [this](http://www.diffordsguide.com/class-magazine/read-online/en/2012-10-09/page-7/tony-abou-ganim) article on diffordsguide.  
Getting back to the Brass Rail cocktail, my extensive searching for a recipe originally only turned up a recipe found on diffordsguide, which as you can see below, is extremely odd. Undeterred by this and curious as to how rum and Bénédictine worked together, I moved forward with a couple versions that I hope better represent this forgotten modern cocktail.  

**Recipes**  
via [diffordsguide.com](http://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/564/brass-rail?display=oz)  
* 2 oz white rum  
* 0.5 oz Bénédictine  
* 0.5 oz lemon juice  
* 2 oz rich simple syrup [wtf?!]  
* ½ egg white  
* 1 dash orange bitters  
Shake on ice and fine strain into chilled glass

*The Modern Mixologist*, Tony Abou-Ganim, 2010  
* 1.5 oz Cruzan Single Barrel rum  
* 0.75 oz B&B  
* 1.5 oz fresh lemon sour [at 2:1 lemon juice:simple syrup – equivalent to 1 oz lemon, 0.5 oz simple syrup]  
* 1 tsp egg white  
* 2 dashes Angostura orange bitters  
In a mixing glass, add rum, B&B, fresh lemon sour, egg white, and orange bitters; shake with ice until well blended. Strain into a chilled cocktail coupe. Garnish with the essence of a burnt orange twist and discard. Sprinkle surface with ground cinnamon. 

**Results**  
As I previously mentioned, I originally became intrigued by this cocktail due to the dearth of information or recipes for it. Additionally, the obvious typo in the diffordsguide recipe seemed like something that needed rectifying, so I took it upon myself to try and figure out what the intended recipe was and share that with everyone here. Thinking about possibilities for what the original recipe was that mistakenly resulted in the published one asking for two full ounces of rich simple syrup, I first considered that it perhaps originally asked for ½ oz, which somehow got misread or truncated. From this spec, I mixed up an initial attempt at the Brass Rail which is pictured in the imgur album. The nose of this cocktail has a faint floral aroma and a bit of citrus bitterness, I think primarily from the aromatics of orange bitters. In the mouth it is pleasantly full textured and surprisingly flavorful. Thanks to the egg white, it comes across as silky smooth and with a creamy sensation. Flavor-wise, it starts off with the sweet herbal flavors of Bénédictine, which combine with lemon, before progressing into the crisp white rum, and finishing with the dry character of rum and orange bitters. With this version, I could see how this might be considered a subtle and refined take on the classic Daiquiri, but it still seemed too sweet, especially given how I didn’t even use rich syrup, just normal simple syrup, so a ½ oz of rich syrup would definitely take it over the line.  
I then considered that perhaps instead of 2 oz, the original recipe may have called for 2 dashes, with that distinction between dash and oz lost somewhere along the way. I then mixed up a version using one barspoon of simple syrup, since I don’t have any feasible way to do dashes of simple syrup. This version was very similar aroma-wise to the previous version, though a bit thinner in texture due to it having less syrup. Additionally, the lemon comes through a bit more in the flavor and I think ultimately the drink being a bit drier brings it closer to the classic Daiquiri that it is distantly inspired by. If forced to choose, I would believe that this is the original intended recipe.  
In the process of writing this post up though, I was able to turn up the recipe from his book *The Modern Mixologist*, which varies quite significantly from the recipes I’ve found. Not actually owning his book, I’m not sure if the change from using Bénédictine to B&B is to make it more accessible. It results in a version that dials back on the unique flavor of Bénédictine and appears to have more lemon juice. I haven’t tried this version yet, but if anybody does, I’d be interested in hearing if it’s any good. 

**Bénédictine**  
I originally wrote a bit about the history of Bénédictine in an old post on the [Montgomery Smith](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/17kqvh/not_cocktail_of_the_week_4_montgomery_smith/), a cocktail that attempts to meld the strong flavors of Fernet Branca with this honey and herb liqueur. I recently purchased a copy of *The Drunken Botanist* by Amy Stewart and in addition to the hyssop, angelica, and lemon balm that I refer to in my original description, also mentions nutmeg and vanilla as two major flavor components of Bénédictine. Either way it’s a delicious and surprisingly versatile liqueur and one I personally consider essential. Some of the previous NCotW utilizing Bénédictine are the [Bobby Burns](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/169jv7/cocktail_of_the_week_3_bobby_burns/), the [Vieux Carré](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1a8cs5/not_cocktail_of_the_week_10_vieux_carr%C3%A9/), the [Monte Carlo](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1fa6vy/not_cocktail_of_the_week_21_monte_carlo/), and the [Widow’s Kiss](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1toslc/not_cocktail_of_the_week_51_widows_kiss/).

**Cheers!**  
Hopefully I’ve given you yet another tasty reason to either use the Bénédictine in your cabinet, or go out and buy a bottle. Thanks to all for the continued support and appreciation of NCotW on /r/cocktails and a big thanks to /u/bitcheslovebanjos for the impressive work he put into last week’s guest contribution. If you’re interested in contributing to /r/cocktails through NCotW, drop me a line and I’ll find a time to work you into the schedule. Please leave your comments and feedback below, especially if you try the recipe from *The Modern Mixologist*. I’m planning to take a break from all these fancy liqueurs and share a simple delicious cocktail next week. Until then dear readers, cheers!
