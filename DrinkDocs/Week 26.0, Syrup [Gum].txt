**(Not) Cocktail of the Week #26: Improved Whiskey Cocktail**  
Thanks to /u/montreal-gloryhole for taking over last week and writing a great post on the Angostura Sour while I was on a brief vacation, a drink I haven’t had either the pleasure or enough Angostura bitters to try. For this week’s post, I’m going way far back in cocktail history to share with you all a very classic cocktail courtesy of the man who single-handedly made bartending and cocktails the culture that it is today, ‘Professor’ Jerry Thomas. It conveniently seems fitting for celebrating America’s Independence Day, for cocktails are a uniquely American invention and this is about as old as they come.

**Background**  
The Improved Whiskey Cocktail comes to us by way of ‘Professor’ Jerry Thomas, a rare breed of bartender who took it upon himself to break the mold and write down the many recipes a bartender carried in his head. In an age where bartending was considered an art, these recipes were considered trade secrets and had never been written and shared with the masses before. I’ve learned much about ‘Professor’ Jerry Thomas as I’ve recently acquired and slowly working through a copy of *Imbibe!* by David Wondrich, who dedicates the entire introductory chapter to the life, lifestyle, and livelihood of this monumental man.  
Jerry P. Thomas was born at some point in 1830 (or 1829) and over the course of his 55 year life, he wore many hats. As David Wondrich puts it, 
> He was a gold miner, a Broadway dandy, a (minor) theatrical impresario, an art collector, an artist himself (of sorts, anyway), an inventor, an author, and a gambler.  

After a brief stint enjoying the Navy’s rum rations (and working I suppose) 1846-1849, the young Jerry Thomas relocated to San Francisco during the Gold Rush from his hometown in New York. As a gold miner, Jerry Thomas was not very successful, but he ultimately hit gold in a fashion by becoming a very successful bartender. He was so successful in San Francisco that when he decided to head back East following a tragic end to his band of minstrels, he spent the staggering sum of $16,000 (approx. $300,000 today) traveling across the country in luxury. Jerry Thomas clearly lived and loved life as a member of the “sporting fraternity”, whose members considered money not as an object, but instead as a process, something that came and went but ultimately contributed to their daily enjoyment. After further success on the East Coast, he continued to live up to that reputation, described in 1863 after moving back to San Francisco as “a gentleman who is all ablaze with diamonds,” having a diamond pin, rings, and cuff links.  It was also around this time that he penned *The Bar-Tender’s Guide*, which you can actually read for free [here](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YixiPjSSEtoC) and includes some bonus content from David Wondrich himself. I’ve probably done a rather poor job trying to briefly summarize ‘Professor’ Jerry Thomas’ life by simply cribbing some of the more interesting anecdotes from *Imbibe!*, so if you want to learn more, do yourself a favor and pick up David Wondrich’s James Beard Award winning book yourself. It’s turning out to be a great historical read about cocktails and their origins.  
The Improved Whiskey Cocktail is a variation of a Cocktail in the strictest sense, which was once defined as being comprised of spirits, sugar, water, and bitters. As a side note, this is often mistakenly considered as the reason I usually name this column *Not* Cocktail of the Week ;). Alongside 12 other cocktails (people were much more inclined to punches and cobblers at the time), the original “Cocktail” was documented by ‘Professor’ Jerry Thomas in the original 1862 printing of *The Bar-Tender’s Guide*, and was comprised of 3-4 dashes gum syrup, 2 dashes bitters, 2 oz of spirits (Holland gin, brandy, or whiskey being most common), 1-2 dashes of curacao, 1 piece of lemon peel, shaken on ice, and served. Using whiskey as the base spirit resulted in a Whiskey Cocktail and gin fittingly as a Gin cocktail. David Wondrich questions the inclusion of curacao in this recipe and figures that it was normally omitted but only included because of its trendiness at the time. By straining this and garnishing with the lemon peel, you end up with what he considers a Fancy Cocktail. In the 1876 reprint, we find the addition of the Improved Cocktail, which substitutes maraschino liqueur for the curacao and adds a dash of absinthe, which was all the rage at the time, bringing the total number of cocktails to 15. By the 3rd reprinting in 1887, vermouth had made its way into cocktails and so the repertoire of cocktails increased to a staggering 23. It is from these humble origins that bartending and cocktails as we know today grew out of; and it is this history that we should always be cognizant of as we continue to explore and push the envelope.

* 1 piece lemon rind

Fill glass one-third full of shaved ice, shake well, and strain into a fancy cocktail glass. The flavor is improved by moistening the edge of the cocktail glass with a piece of lemon.

**Results**  
I went with the recipe from PDT as it seemed to best respect the original recipe from ‘Professor’ Jerry Thomas’ *The Bar-Tender’s Guide*. My first reaction to this cocktail was surprise at how sweet it turned out, either due to the fact that 20% of this cocktail is comprised of sweet components or the absinthe is enhancing how much sweetness I taste. The nose is very lemony, which really goes to emphasize the importance of including the citrus twist when called for, given the close relation between smell and taste, as my initial taste is strongly of lemon oil. The flavors then transition to the sweetness of maraschino liqueur and finish with the strong spicy backbone of rye and bitterness of Angostura. I really enjoyed the combination of the woodsy character of Luxardo with lemon oil for some reason, but found it hard to notice the addition of absinthe. Perhaps it is serving to enhance and shift the flavor profile in a subtle way. At some point I will have to try two side by side to see if I can tell the difference, or if someone wants to undertake that experiment and report back here, I’m sure we’d all appreciate it. I found this cocktail to be bitter with a clean finish, which may stem from my relatively heavy-handedness with my dashes, and a bit sweet for my taste. Perhaps next time I should try measuring out the equivalent of dashes for the maraschino and simple syrup, David Wondrich suggests 1 tsp. gum syrup, ½ tsp. maraschino, and 1/8 tsp. absinthe.  

**Variations**  
Obviously variations on the Improved Whiskey Cocktail would be its predecessors, the Fancy Whiskey Cocktail, and the original Whiskey Cocktail. It would also be interesting to either buy a modern version of Boker’s bitters or to recreate it by making your own (potential project for someone here), and see how it affects the cocktail. I recall seeing David Wondrich’s recipe for Boker’s bitters somewhere in *Imbibe!*, so if someone wants to give it a shot, send me a message. As such an old cocktail carrying a lot of the history behind cocktails, I respectfully do not think that much variation is needed. Perhaps one could improve on the ratios to adjust for taste, but it’s really a great cocktail on its own.  

**Maraschino Liqueur**  
I originally planned to write up a section on maraschino liqueur here, but as I’ve run a bit short on time, and my character count (it’s over 9,000...) is already pushing the limit due to my brief sketch on ‘Professor’ Jerry Thomas, I will revisit this at a later time.

**Cheers!**  
Thanks for reading this week’s NCotW, I hope this gives people an interesting simple, yet classic, cocktail utilizing maraschino liqueur. I loved seeing the pictures of the Clover Club people submitted a couple weeks back, so if you make this cocktail, do feel free to share how you liked it and how you made it. Otherwise, your comments, critiques, suggestions, and questions are always appreciated. If you’ve enjoyed this series, rather than reddit gold (which I’ve generously been gifted a number of times), find my cocktail book wishlist [here](http://amzn.com/w/LJIN08K4RTJW), or contact me for my Cocktail Kingdom wishlist (of which I’ll probably be buying a decent chunk of myself for my upcoming birthday :P). Happy Independence Day and until next week, cheers!
