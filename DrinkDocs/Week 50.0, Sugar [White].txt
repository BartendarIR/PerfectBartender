**Not Cocktail of the Week #48: Hot Milk Punch**  
Hopefully many of you were inspired to make some fresh eggnog and potentially even age a batch after last week’s NCotW, but in case you haven’t, I wanted to share a simple hot drink that will help keep you warm this Christmas and also be friendlier to those averse to raw eggs. 

**Background**  
Somehow there doesn’t seem to be much actual history as to the background of Milk Punch, but it has persisted as a cocktail enjoyed year round in New Orleans and has some association with the holiday season, probably due to its similarities to eggnog (which itself is actually occasionally referred to as egg milk punch). I hypothesize that Milk Punch has a similar history as to that of Eggnog (which you can read about in last week’s column), as old recipes for Milk Punch sometimes refer to the old English drink of posset. A relatively “modern” recipe for the Milk Punch and Hot Milk Punch we know of today are found in Jerry Thomas’ *How to Mix Drinks*, published in 1862, but there actually is earlier documentation of it from Benjamin Franklin in 1763.  
Milk Punch one hundred years before Jerry Thomas was a little bit different, likely due to the lack of any means to refrigerate and preserve drinks, and was then essentially whey-based, as the milk was curdled by the addition of lemon juice and strained before serving. I haven’t yet been adventurous enough to try a curdled Milk Punch, but you can find Benjamin Franklin’s brandy-based recipe [here](http://www.masshist.org/database/viewer.php?old=1&item_id=294) as well as an interesting article about them by Serious Drinks [here](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/01/clear-english-milk-punch-curdled-milk-punch-historical-drinks.html). If you’re willing to give making this a try, I’d love to hear about how it turned out. I will probably have to add this to my to-do list of things to drink. 

**Recipes**  
*How to Mix Drinks*, Jerry Thomas, 1862  
*Milk Punch*  
(Use large bar glass) [pint glass?]  
* 1 tbsp fine white sugar  
* 2 tbsp water  
* 1 wine-glass Cognac [2 oz]  
* 1/2 wine-glass Santa Cruz rum [1 oz]  
* 1/3 tumblerful shaved ice  
Fill with milk [volume unclear], shake the ingredients well together, and grate a little nutmeg on top.   

*Hot Milk Punch*  
This punch is made the same as the above, with the exception that hot milk is used, and no ice.  

Notes from *Imbibe!*, David Wondrich, 2007  
On ingredients: “…the spirits can be safely reduced here without affecting the drink’s epicurean qualities.”  
On execution: “in preparing any kind of a hot drink, the glass should always be first rinsed rapidly with hot water; if this is not done, the drink cannot be served sufficiently hot to suit a fastidious customer.”  

My recipe [yield approx. 8 oz]  
* 1.0 oz cognac  
* 0.5 oz dark rum  
* 2 tsp granulated sugar  
* 6 oz hot milk [edit: I use whole milk for its stronger character and creamier mouthfeel]  
* nutmeg to garnish  
Briefly stir sugar and spirits, then add hot milk while stirring. Garnish with fresh grated nutmeg and serve.

**Results**  
Figuring out a palatable recipe for Hot Milk Punch took a little longer than I expected, but I think after some experimentation, I managed to come close to something I might occasionally enjoy. The largest challenge was that most recipes for Hot Milk Punch do not specify either the final volume or any volume for the milk component. In order to come up with a clear and consistent recipe, I first looked at Jerry Thomas’ recipe, assuming a large mixing glass to be something close to a pint glass filled to ~12 oz final volume with 3 oz of that being comprised of spirits. I also look at the recipe by David Wondrich on Esquire, figuring an Irish coffee glass mug is usually ~8 oz, with 2 oz of spirits called for in the recipe. Finally, digging through my own notebook for my Milk Punch recipe, I saw that it is a 6 oz recipe utilizing 1.5 oz of spirits. From these examples, I figured that both Milk Punch and Hot Milk Punch has 25% of its total volume comprised of spirits, whether it is bourbon, cognac, or rum.  
Following this guideline, I first mixed up a cup of Hot Milk Punch as per Jerry Thomas’ recipe with 25% total volume being spirits. The aroma of this is spicy from the nutmeg, creamy from the milk, with a solid punch in the nose from the hot Cognac and rum. I feel like alcohol behaves and tastes very different at hot temperatures than cold, being very up front, but very brief across the palate. Instead of much flavor, you get a lot more of the alcohol sensation it permeates your sinuses when you swallow. After swallowing, I then got the sweet and creamy flavors I’m more accustomed to in Milk Punch with some fruitiness from Cognac and a dark edge from the rum. It’s a very warming and relaxing drink, though I found the initial alcohol hit from the heated spirits a little unpleasant.  
For the second attempt, I decided to decrease the total volume of spirits to 20% and found that I enjoyed this version a lot more and thus included this as my final recipe above. This was overall much more palatable and better balanced, lacking the harsh edge from heated spirits. The nose is now more spice and cream, with a hint of alcohol. In the mouth, the milk and spirits intertwine more harmoniously, rather than as disparate elements. The finish is still similar to above and this version I can definitely see being rather soporific, or as David Wondrich puts it, “Liquid Ambien.”  
As a bonus version, I thought it would be interesting to put aside the rum and do a version using that spiced rich syrup that I used in the [Afonso de Albuquerque](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1rlin2/not_cocktail_of_the_week_47_vasco_de_gamaafonso/) and [Freestyle Fall Punch](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1rbn5a/freestyle_fall_punch/) from a couple weeks back. I substituted 2 tsp of spiced rich syrup for 2 tsp sugar and used Cognac alone at a 20% final volume figuring I did not need the additional spice notes from rum. This was also a pleasant Hot Milk Punch that was noticeably more silky in the mouth and had a little additional depth from the holiday spices in the spiced rich syrup. It was a little sweeter than the previous versions and I felt had some mild resemblance to fruitcake in its flavor profile. If nothing else, it might pair nicely with the traditional Christmas fruitcake.  

**Variations**  
As with Eggnog, there are a ton of different recipes for Milk Punch, though definitely less for Hot Milk Punch. I did stumble across this recipe for a [Hot Coconut Milk Punch from Saveur](http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Hot-Coconut-Milk-Punch) which sounded delicious because my wife and I both really enjoy coconut milk. I might try and surprise her with some of this on Christmas. 

**Cheers!**  
Christmas is just one week away with the end of 2013 and a year’s worth of NCotW soon after. This week’s recipe is pretty simple, you can easily substitute your dark brown spirit of choice in place of the Cognac and rum, so hopefully many of you will be able to give this a try and share your experience with the rest of us in the comments. If you are feeling especially in the Christmas spirit after all of these winter cocktails, I have a cocktail-oriented Amazon wishlist [here]( http://amzn.com/w/LJIN08K4RTJW) and have less than a month of reddit gold remaining *hint hint*. Thanks for all your guys’ continued support of these articles. Cheers!
