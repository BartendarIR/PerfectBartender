**Not Cocktail of the Week #57: Bronco Buster**  
While I was researching and collecting recipes for the Bronx cocktail that I originally planned to share this week, I serendipitously came across the Bronco Buster cocktail, which immediately preceded the Bronx cocktail, in my Bartender’s Choice app. If you watched Super Bowl XLVIII this past Sunday, you witnessed the Denver Broncos being completely trounced by the Seattle Seahawks. Given the momentous occasion of the first Lombardi Trophy for Seattle, I simply had to put this post together at the last minute to share this obscure but unusually delicious cocktail. 

**Background**  
As someone who spent 20+ years growing up in Seattle and living through the inevitable disappointment and heartbreak that is Seattle sports (the Seattle Mariners every year, the poor officiating of Super Bowl XL for the 2004/2005 Seattle Seahawks, and the leaving of the Seattle Supersonics for Oklahoma City in 2008), victory in Super Bowl XLVIII was sweet redemption as our beloved Seahawks dominated beyond doubt the Denver Broncos, the oft-touted #1 offense, with a score of 43-8. While some complain about the game being so one-sided as to become boring, I loved every minute and have probably spent an equal amount of time just watching replays and highlights from the game. Anyways, not to go on too much about football in a cocktail column, there is a little actual history to the Bronco Buster, which is found in Ted Saucier’s 1951 *Bottom’s Up!* and credited to the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona.  

**Recipes**  
*Bartender’s Choice* [app](http://bartenderschoiceapp.com/wordpress/), created by Sam Ross and the bartenders at Milk + Honey in NYC, 2012  
* 1 oz rye  
* 1 oz applejack  
* 0.75 oz curacao  
* 0.75 oz lemon juice  
Add all ingredients to shaker, fill completely with ice and shake vigorously. Strain into glass.

**Results**  
While I don’t usually have a curacao proper in my cabinet, you can approximate curacao by mixing equal parts of a good quality triple sec like Cointreau with 1:1 cane sugar simple syrup. As I was a couple tastings in of the Bronx cocktail, I have to admit that initially I failed to realize the recipe called for curacao and so my initial assessment was this cocktail was much too sour for my liking. Luckily, adding in the appropriate amount of cane sugar simple syrup remedied that rather quickly. Additionally, while the Bronco Buster calls for applejack, I substitute in Laird’s bonded apple brandy, which packs a lot more apple flavor and isn’t diluted with neutral grain spirits. To stand up to the flavor of the bonded apple brandy, I highly recommend Rittenhouse bonded rye whiskey if available, as it is still relatively affordable and worth well beyond its cost would imply.  
I love the heady aroma that Laird’s bonded apple brandy brings to a drink, in this case combining with the sweet citrus fragrance of lemon and the spicy notes of rye. Flavor-wise, the Bronco Buster starts with the tart lemon note, immediately balanced with the sweet fruitiness apple and orange, finishing with the robust flavors of rye whiskey. Despite the use of two 100-proof spirits, this cocktail is dangerously easy drinking with its well-balanced ratio of sweet and sour disguising its strength. Despite serving it on a large cube, it is difficult to merely sip on and ultimately goes by much too quickly. 

**Cheers!**  
Hope you’ve enjoyed this short and sweet post on the Bronco Buster. I’ll be getting back to the Bronx cocktail in the near future, but for this week, let us Seattlites bask in the victory of Super Bowl XLVIII. If you have any questions, comments, feedback, or want to share how you’ve enjoyed a Bronco Buster yourself, please do so in the comments below. Thanks to those anonymous supporters that provided me with two months worth of reddit gold when I needed it last week, I am truly appreciative. Let us all toast to the end of the 2013 NFL season, to the Seahawks victory over the Broncos, and to their continued success next year. Cheers and GO HAWKS!
