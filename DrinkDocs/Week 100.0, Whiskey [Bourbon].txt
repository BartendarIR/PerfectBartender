**Not Cocktail of the Week #100: Black Manhattan**  
To start off, a big thanks to /u/bitcheslovebanjos for filling in for me last week while I was off having a blast in Taipei with a great post on the [Brooklyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2ni3ba/not_cocktail_of_the_week_99_the_brooklyn/). For this week’s NCotW, I wanted to share a modern cocktail that /u/charles-sartier-jr serendipitously [posted about a couple weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2mh7w7/cocktails_using_amaro_the_black_manhattan), but has been on my original schedule as I wanted everyone to have another use for the Averna used in the [Flannel Shirt](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2m3rsx/not_cocktail_of_the_week_97_flannel_shirt/). It’s simple, satisfying, and seasonal.  

**Background**  
Despite this cocktail’s relative popularity, it was surprisingly difficult to track down the origins of this cocktail with no individual claiming credit for inventing it. That said, I did eventually uncover a consistent trail of crumbs that lead me to believe that this was created in 2007 at Bourbon and Branch. Reading the [recipe](http://www.kindredcocktails.com/cocktail/black-manhattan) at Kindred Cocktails, it credits Bourbon and Branch, pointing to a Washington Post [article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/recipes/black-manhattan/10120/) from 2008. However, in an earlier 2007 [article](http://www.sfgate.com/wine/article/The-Manhattan-project-A-bartender-spills-his-2502224.php) on Manhattans by Gary Regan for the SF Chronicle, he mentions the Black Manhattan at Bourbon and Branch; and shortly after, Paul Clarke writes a followup [blurb](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2007/09/ill-take-a-manhattan.html) for Serious Eats. This, of course, led me to get in touch with my friend at Bourbon and Branch to try and get some inside information. While he wasn’t able to get any solid answers as to an individual responsible for the drink, I did at least come away with their recipe.

**Recipes**  
via /u/AlmightyJ, Bourbon and Branch, 2007  
* 2 oz Buffalo Trace bourbon  
* 0.75 oz Averna (most other recipes have this at 1 oz)  
* 2 dashes whiskey barrel bitters^#  
Stir on ice, strain into small cocktail glass, garnish with brandied cherry.  
^# Note: other bitters have been used previously, cherry-coffee being mentioned in Gary Regan’s article. Currently they use their house Old-Fashioned bitters described as “an aromatic bitters flavored with baking spices (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, etc)” so I would just use your favorite aromatic bitters.

**Results**  
This drink is strikingly dark, living up to its name as the Black Manhattan. On the nose, I get mostly wood and vanilla from the bourbon combining with an herbal note from Averna. Later on, I get a hint of fruit and spice notes coming through. Texturally, this is a thick and full-bodied drink thanks to the Averna. Upon sipping, I first note an interesting flavor that I characterize as dry dusty paper and something I typically associate with Peychaud’s. I’m not sure how to better describe it, but for a moment it tastes as a bookstore smells. After that, the bourbon and Angostura kick in with their spice notes, followed by the arrival of Averna announced by an herbal bitter note which lingers to combine with the bitter Angostura profile on the dry finish. It is a sweet and assertive drink with a unique caramel and spice component thanks to the Averna, but not overly bitter despite the combination of an amaro and aromatic bitters. 

**Averna**  
I’m not sure when I’ll next have a chance to write about Averna, so I thought I would share what I’ve learned about it here this week. Averna comes from and is still produced in Caltanissetta, Sicily. It is named after Salvatore Averna, a successful textile merchant, who frequented and generously supported the monks at the nearby Convent of St. Spirito. In 1859, as a sign of gratitude, the herbalist Friar Girolamo gifted him the recipe for an “herbal elixir”, which may potentially trace its roots to the Benedictine monks. Some years later in 1868, Salvatore Averna began serving this “herbal elixir” to his family and guests. Salvatore’s enterprising son Francesco began sharing his father’s creation by bringing it to both local fairs and abroad. Somehow Francesco found himself serving Averna to King Umberto I in 1895, receiving a golden brooch in exchange. The popularity of Averna continue to grow and similarly within the Royal Household as Umberto’s successor, Emanuele III, named Averna their official supplier in 1912. Through the two World Wars, the Averna family continued to develop and grow their family business, becoming a public company in 1958 and the leading amaro sold in Italy since 1978. You can read a bit more detail about its history from the Averna website [here](http://www.averna.it/en/history.htm) or this [article](http://www.worldguide.eu/wg/index.php?StoryID=408&ArticleID=22940) from World Guide.  
As with all amari, the recipe for Averna remains a secret with only select members of the Averna family knowing the complete recipe. It is said to consist of an infusion of herbs, roots, berries, dried fruits, bark, and citrus peel, sweetened and colored with caramel. A labor-intensive product, it takes six months for all the infusions, blending, and aging to produce the finished product. Its color is dark amber with a thick and velvety texture. It is described as being moderately bitter with flavors of spice, wood, citrus, and caramel, lying somewhere between Ramazzotti and Amer Picon, though personally I thought the most interesting description of its flavor was that of flat Coca-Cola. 

**Cheers!**  
Thanks for reading this week’s NCotW post, if you recently picked up a bottle of Averna, or have some on hand, I sincerely hope you give this one a try. As usual, I look forward to the discussions in the comments below. If you missed the news, the book I was trying to get funded through redditmade fell short, but if you have some feedback you’re willing to share on that project, please [click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2o6gqd/not_cocktail_of_the_week_book_update_2_falling/) to share your thoughts. Until next week, cheers!
