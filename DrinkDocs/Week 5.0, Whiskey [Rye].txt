**Not Cocktail of the Week #5: Boulevardier**  
For this week’s post, I thought I’d write about a classic cocktail that first introduced me to the joys of Campari, the Boulevardier. If you’re still stuck in the throes of winter and are looking for other appropriate classic cocktails to warm up with, check out my previous posts on the [Bobby Burns](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/169jv7/cocktail_of_the_week_3_bobby_burns/) or the [Manhattan](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/16pciv/not_cocktail_of_the_week_2_the_manhattan/).   

**Background**  
The creation of the Boulevardier was documented in 1927 by Harry McElhone at Harry’s New York Bar, which was located in Paris (how confusing). As with much of cocktail history, the origins of this cocktail was a result of Prohibition. Harry McElhone was originally a bartender at the Plaza Hotel in New York, but when Prohibition was enacted, the obvious difficulties spurred him to move to Europe where he encountered a wide range of new ingredients such as the bitter Italian apéritif Campari. Straddling the line between American whiskey and Italian Campari, he came up with the Boulevardier cocktail, named after the literary magazine helmed by Erskine Gwynne.  
At first glance, you would think this is a derivative of the Negroni (comprised of equal parts dry gin, sweet vermouth and Campari), with the Boulevardier substituting bourbon whiskey in place of the dry gin. However, it turns out that Boulevardier predates the Negroni by nearly 20 years, as the Negroni was never documented until 1947 despite its purported origins in the 1920s. Maybe Count Camillo Negroni just couldn’t be bothered to write his variation on the Americano down anywhere. Either way, this is a delicious use of Campari and an underappreciated classic cocktail today.

 *[New York Times](http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/case-study-the-boulevardier/)*  
* 2.0 oz bourbon or rye  
* 1.0 oz Campari  
* 1.0 oz sweet vermouth  
Stirred on ice, garnish lemon twist  

**Results**  
This is another cocktail I don’t make often enough. It’s quite delicious, a cousin to the Manhattan, but relying on Campari to provide its unique bitter profile in place of Angostura. In addition to the beautiful red hue Campari imparts to the cocktail, as a liqueur, it results in a sweeter cocktail and a much longer bitter finish. The initial flavor is briefly somewhere between a Manhattan and an Old-Fashioned but matures immediately into the unique citrusy bitterness of Campari.  
 
**Variations**  
As can be seen from the recipes, the modern interpretation of the Boulevardier takes a more spirit-forward approach compared to the sweeter initial incarnation. The substitution of rye for bourbon gives a much more flavorful and robust cocktail tempering the sweetness of Campari while not losing its bitter profile. The Campari in this cocktail can also be substituted or combined with other bitter amari, as mentioned in the article by the New York Times above.   
Usage of different sweet vermouth also can change this cocktail quite a bit, Jeffrey Morgenthaler refers the flavor of Campari + Carpano Antica as “[Tootsie Roll](http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/summer-in-a-bottle-americano-soda/)” (PS the Americano is a great summer cocktail), but I haven’t yet had a chance to restock Carpano and only have Dolin Rouge for now. A significant twist on the Boulevardier is to use dry vermouth in place of the sweet vermouth resulting in a cocktail known as the Old Pal (also aptly pointed out by user SoMuchMoreEagle). As suggested by user [Mushead](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/17yl4t/not_cocktail_of_the_week_5_preview/c89zmme) in the comments of my preview post, a dry sherry may also be used in substitution of the sweet vermouth. I am not familiar with working with sherry, so how this would change the cocktail, I’m not yet sure, but I am definitely intrigued by the idea.  

**Campari**  
For the section where I try to feature a particularly interesting aspect of this week’s cocktail, I thought I would take this as an opportunity to learn a little more about Campari and share it. Campari was first invented all the way back in 1860 by a fellow known as Gaspare Campari. Its blend of herbs, aromatic plants, and fruit, are unsurprisingly a trade secret, known only a handful of people. It has been reported to have anywhere from 20 to 60 ingredients, but its main flavor notes are quinine, rhubarb, ginseng and orange peel, which give it a very bracing and unique bitterness. Personally, if I were to try and describe it to somebody else, I would have to say it is an awful lot like cough syrup, but somehow delicious.  
Over the last century, Campari has continued to thrive, through appealing and aggressive marketing. The history of Campari ads, as can be seen [here](http://www.campari.com/int/en/campari-world/history/), is really quite interesting as you can see as their ads reflect both the art and historical events of the time. In the 1890s, Campari started a calendar featuring artwork from the artist Cesare Tallone, who painted a beautiful woman representing the essence of Campari. Over the next 100 years, many artists contributed to advertising the Campari brand, often playing on the red color and perpetually cultivating the image that Campari is modern. The Campari calendar has recently featured alluring women such as Eva Mendes, Salma Hayek and Jessica Alba (note to self: find these calendars).   
Almost 150 years after the invention of Campari, in 2006 its most striking feature, the deep red color, became a topic for discussion in the cocktail scene. Originally, the redness of Campari was due to carmine, which is derived from crushed cochineal beetles. Yes, one of the original ingredients in Campari could be considered beetle juice. However, between arguments over having to slap an “insect-derived” label on things using carmine and the sharp rise in our modern hypersensitive population becoming allergic to everything under the sun, Campari switched to an artificial plant-based dye. Unfortunately this may have coincided with a modification in its recipe, as I have come across a [report](http://drinkmemag.com/2010/07/hard-times-for-the-hard-shelled/) that the “old Campari” was less sweet and more complex. So if you have an old bottle of Campari, maybe go buy a new bottle and do a side-by-side tasting. I’d love to hear your experience!  

**Cheers!**  
Hope you’ve enjoyed this week’s post, let me know how you like your own Boulevardier (though many of you already have in my accompanying preview post), and if you don’t own a bottle of Campari, I hope this post will spur you to get one. Pick one up on your way home or for this weekend. It’s worth it and there will definitely be more cocktails with it in your future as it finds its place in my cocktails around the year.
