**Not Cocktail of the Week #68: Jake Barnes**  
Thanks to /u/whaleodile for last week’s post on the [20th Century](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2377jm/not_cocktail_of_the_week_67_the_20th_century/). I had never heard of the 20th Century until he contacted me wanting to share it with all of you, but did have an opportunity to give it a try at a friend’s more extensively stocked bar. It’s definitely a great and classy use of crème de cacao if you have it. For this week’s NCotW, I wanted to continue with another applejack-based cocktail, but additionally introduce pineapple juice as an ingredient I plan to revisit over the next few weeks (so you should probably buy some).  

**Background**  
I initially came across the Jake Barnes cocktail in Gary ‘gaz’ Regan’s cocktail newsletter, where he regularly features cocktails by modern bartenders that he deems worthy of being included in his yearly “101 Best New Cocktails”. The Jake Barnes is essentially a simple and masterfully executed twist on the classic [Jack Rose](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1bnysd/not_cocktail_of_the_week_13_jack_rose/). As with most modern cocktails, the Jake Barnes has little history other than its creation by Natalie Jacob from the bar Dutch Kills in Long Island, New York. She shares her thought process behind the creation of this cocktail, as a combination of the Jack in the Box (apple brandy, pineapple juice, bitters) and the Jack Rose. It comes together really well and left me wondering how many other classic cocktails using lemon juice could be given a unique twist by adding a measure of pineapple juice instead.  

**Recipes**  
* 1.5 oz applejack [sub 1.25 oz bonded apple brandy]  
* 0.75 oz grenadine  
* 0.5 oz lemon juice  
* 0.5 oz pineapple juice  
* 1 dash Angostura bitters  
Shake on ice, strain, garnish with a pineapple wedge

**Results**  
The Jake Barnes, along with most other cocktails using apple brandy, smells absolutely heavenly. I get notes of sweet apple, tart lemon, fruity pineapple, and rich pomegranate in the nose. Flavor-wise, it’s quite intense and almost overwhelming, initially starting with the sweet floral aspect of apple, morphing into the pleasant combination of pineapple and lemon, returning to fruity grenadine, and finishing with a touch of warm spice from the Angostura bitters. Due to the significant amount of pineapple juice and grenadine, this cocktail has a great full-bodied texture on the tongue. I did find that this was perhaps a touch too sweet for my palate, though it could be due to the slightly lower volume from my substitution of bonded apple brandy vs the applejack originally specified. Alternatively, my grenadine could be sweeter than expected, but feel free to adjust the grenadine to taste, which for me might be 0.5 oz. The Jake Barnes is a great modern twist on the Jack Rose and is much too delicious to simply have just one. I definitely went through the one I mixed up for these notes much too quickly. As I brought up in the introduction, I wonder how many other cocktails could benefit from a mix of lemon and pineapple rather than just lemon juice. It certainly would be a simple way to add your own unique spin on a classic cocktail.

**More Applejack Cocktails!**  
Should you need more inspiration, here are some other delicious classics other than the Jack Rose (find that link in the introduction) using applejack or apple brandy. I’ll hopefully write up a brief section on pineapple juice as an ingredient in a future column.

**Cheers!**  
Thanks for all your continued support, especially whoever was kind enough to give me reddit gold for my previous post on the [Blood and Sand](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1yds2e/not_cocktail_of_the_week_59_blood_and_sand/). Hopefully you’re able to give this a try and if you do, I’d love to hear about it in the comments. Otherwise, your feedback and our discussions are always a source of pleasure and educational. Next week should be a great and timely NCotW guest post from /u/GWCad, in fact I would not be surprised if some of you were able to guess the cocktail next week, but I will leave that in his[?] most capable hands. Hopefully things at work will calm down over the next few weeks, but regardless, there is no end to cocktails in my future, so with that, cheers!
