Awesome post. And hilarious, I didn't remember ever serving it in a coupe but I just went and checked my original post, and lo and behold, I guess I did! I barely remember posting that but my guess is that I didn't have a punch glass on hand so I used a coupe. 

Anyway, great write up and thanks for including me!
