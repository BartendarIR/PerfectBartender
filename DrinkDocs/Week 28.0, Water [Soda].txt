**Not Cocktail of the Week #28: Mai Tai**  
Now that summer has fully arrived in San Francisco with partly cloudy skies and a high of 66°F for the entire week, it seemed amusingly ironic to share another often maligned, but classic, rum cocktail known as the Mai Tai with the /r/cocktails community. I have to admit that despite the chilly weather, I still enjoyed a number of these refreshing drinks and I’m confident that they will be even better for everyone else enjoying the heat of summer. Though we’ve missed National Mai Tai Day, which apparently went by unnoticed on June 30, let’s learn a little more about the origins of the Mai Tai cocktail, how to make a proper Mai Tai, and a little about orgeat, one of its key ingredients. 

**Background**  
The Mai Tai, or Maita’i (the Tahitian word for good), is a cocktail with an understandably contentious origin story given its popularity. The more widely accepted story is that in 1944, Victor Bergeron, owner of the popular Trader Vic’s in Emeryville, California, wanted to take advantage of some nice Jamaican rum he had on hand to entertain some friends from Tahiti, Eastham and Carrie Guild. Combining the rum with lime juice, orgeat, curacao and some rock candy syrup, he served what was presumably the first Mai Tai ever to them, upon which Carrie exclaimed, “Mai tai roa ae!” which roughly translates to “out of this world” or “the best”. When asked what this amazing concoction was called, Trader Vic decided the name of the cocktail then and there to be the Mai Tai. However, the other origin story comes from Trader Vic’s rival, Ernest Gantt aka Donn Beach aka Don the Beachcomber, another legendary figure in the Tiki drink world. He claims to have concocted the a similar drink, called the Q.B. Cooler (see /u/montreal-gloryhole 's [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1ii3l5/not_cocktail_of_the_week_28_mai_tai/cb4rujz)) in 1933 and claims that Trader Vic took this as inspiration for his Mai Tai. Either way, the classic Mai Tai that we know today resembles Trader Vic’s recipe, whether due to his legitimate invention of it or clever marketing (and copyright). That said, what most people have in mind when they hear Mai Tai is similarly distant from Trader Vic’s original intent, which was to showcase the flavor of a great rum, stating that “The flavor of this great rum wasn’t meant to be overpowered with heavy additions of fruit juices and flavorings,” which unfortunately got forgotten as people sought to profit on this delicious cocktail substituting cheaper rums and a heavy dose of pineapple juice rather than lime. The slow erosion of the Mai Tai’s original quality and intent has resulted in the poor reputation of this classic cocktail and is something we should keep in mind as we return to its roots. 

**Recipes**  
Don the Beachcomber’s Q.B. Cooler, 1933  
* 1 oz orange juice  
* 1 oz fresh lime juice  
* 1 oz honey syrup (1:1 honey:water)  
* 1 oz falernum  
* 1 oz soda water  
* 1 oz gold Jamaican rum  
* 1 oz light Puerto Rican rum  
* 0.5 oz Demerara rum  
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters  
* 1/2 tsp ginger syrup  
* 4 oz crushed ice  
Blend for 5 seconds and pour unstrained into double rocks glass and top with more crushed ice. Garnish with mint sprigs, julep style.  
Shake on ice and strain into a highball glass filled with crushed ice. Garnish with fruits and serve with straw.

Trader Vic’s original recipe, 1944  
* 2 oz 17-year J. Wray Nephew Jamaican rum  
* 1 oz lime juice  
* 0.5 oz French Garnier orgeat  
* 0.5 oz Holland DeKuyper orange curacao  
* 0.25 oz rock candy syrup  
Shake and strain into an old-fashioned glass filled with crushed ice, garnish with a sprig of fresh mint.  

Recipe by Martin Cate, owner of Smuggler’s Cove in San Francisco, as seen [here](http://liquor.com/recipes/traditional-mai-tai)  
* 2 oz premium aged rum (Appleton Estate 12-year or El Dorado 12-year)  
* 0.75 oz fresh lime juice  
* 0.5 oz orange curacao  
* 0.25 oz rock candy syrup (2 parts rock candy, 1 part water)  
* 0.25 oz orgeat almond syrup  
Shake vigorously on crushed ice, pour unstrained into double old-fashioned glass, garnish with a squeeze of lime juice and fresh mint sprig.

My modifications of Martin Cate’s recipe (with notes)  
* 2 oz Flor de cana gold rum  
* 0.75 oz lime juice  
* 0.75 oz turbinado syrup  
* 0.25 oz Cointreau  
* 0.25 oz orgeat  
* 0.5 oz Ron Zacapa 23 to float  
* 1 sprig of fresh mint for garnish  
Shaken hard on ice, serve without straining. Float 0.5 oz aged rum on top and garnish with a lime wedge and mint sprig.  
Note: the original recipe calls for 0.25 oz 2:1 rock candy syrup which I substituted with 0.5 oz 1:1 turbinado syrup; additionally, since I only have Cointreau, I substituted the 0.5 oz curacao with 0.25 oz Cointreau and 0.25 oz turbinado syrup. This results in my final recipe being 0.25 oz Cointreau and 0.75 oz turbinado syrup.

**Results**  
It is obvious that a lot of thought went into Martin Cate’s version of the Mai Tai, as I found it to be an incredibly well-balanced cocktail that really exemplifies what a great Tiki drink can be, blending all the components and flavors together harmoniously into a delicious final product. When first enjoying this cocktail, I appreciate the combination of aromatics from mint, the sharp tang of lime, and sweet caramel vanilla notes of aged rum in my nose. The characteristics of rum are up front and center upon sipping this cocktail, which really emphasize that the quality of the base spirit in this cocktail is very important. The flavors of the other components blend together quite smoothly, which I think is due to the qualities imparted by orgeat. That said, I first detect the bright tartness of lime across my tongue, followed by the distinctive rum and sweet citrus notes, and finishing with a slight funkiness of rum and bitterness of lime. Since I can’t afford to be mixing entire cocktails with aged rum, I find that instead a float can be a nice compromise, with its aromas and flavors leading the way. This cocktail really makes me wish we had a hot and sunny summer in San Francisco, but at the very least, through this cocktail I can at least get the taste of summer. 

**Variations**  
Honestly after the beating that the original Mai Tai has taken, I don’t think much further variation on this classic cocktail needs encouraging. My only suggestions would to be trying different and better rums, and if you have the knowledge, blending different rums to come up with a really stellar Mai Tai. Feel free to share your favorite rum or blend of rums in making this cocktail and stay away from the pineapple juice and paper umbrellas.

**Orgeat**  
To start off, I think it would be remiss of me to not mention how to pronounce orgeat. As someone who doesn’t often get a chance to speak in person with other people about cocktails, I often find out that I have been pronouncing things all wrong in my head after opening my mouth, much to my chagrin. Orgeat is pronounced “or-zhat”, with the hard t optional. Orgeat actually significantly predates Tiki cocktails, originating as crushed barley and water, which after emulsification, served as a substitute for milk prior to the invention of refrigeration. Unless you owned a cow back then, your chances at fresh milk were surprisingly poor, instead you would be more likely to get your dairy in the form of cheese, which was much more resistant to spoilage. Instead of milk, this barley water emulsion could actually be whipped into a whipped cream substitute or churned into a butter-like substitute. Over time, people started adding almonds to their orgeat for a richer flavor, and eventually dropped the barley component altogether, resulting in what we know now as almond milk. Modern orgeat pays homage to its origins by being almond-based, but by the advent of cocktails, had become a cordial incorporating sugar and some orange flower water for additional flavor.  
You can actually make your own orgeat if you are so inclined, there are some great guides that you can find [here](http://www.artofdrink.com/ingredients/syrups/orgeat-syrup) via Art of Drink, [here](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/11/diy-vs-buy-should-you-make-your-own-orgeat-syrup-cocktails-tiki-drinks.html) via Serious Drinks, or [here](http://imbibemagazine.com/Homemade-Orgeat-Recipe) via Imbibe Magazine. All it takes is almonds, sugar, and orange flower water (which you may have on hand to make the Ramos Gin Fizz). I personally haven’t made my own orgeat, but if you don’t have access to quality orgeat like the one I use from Small Hand Foods, which luckily for me is local, making your own may be a good economical choice. If anyone here gives it a shot, do share your results with me in the comments. 

**Cheers!**  
Hope you’ve been enjoying this short foray into rum cocktails, hopefully I’ll have some more to post for you all soon. If you have any suggestions for other delicious classic or modern rum cocktails, I’d love to hear about them in the comments. If you don’t have one yet, buy/make some orgeat and mix yourself a Mai Tai as they are actually quite delicious when not overly sweetened and artificially colored. As an aside, I’ve recently posted a contribution to /u/chalks777 Classic Concoctions competition which can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1i3xvk/contest_classic_concoctions/) and ends this coming Friday. Since it’s fallen off the first page, this seems like a good opportunity to plug it and encourage my readers to go through the submissions and vote for your favorite. Next week’s post will be a day late, so do not worry if you don’t see anything come up at the usual time. Cheers!
