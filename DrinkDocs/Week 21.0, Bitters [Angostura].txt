**Not Cocktail of the Week #21: Monte Carlo**  
Returning from a week off thanks to last week’s guest post on the [White Lady](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1etvbw/not_cocktail_of_the_week_20_the_white_lady_guest/) courtesy of /u/gregbenson314, for this week’s column, I want to present to all of you a cocktail I recently discovered and greatly enjoy known as the Monte Carlo. If you’ve picked up a bottle of Bénédictine in the course of following the NCotW series, this will be another cocktail you can add to your repertoire utilizing that delicious honey and herb liqueur.  

**Background**  
The history of the Monte Carlo, as far as I can find, is rather brief, documented first in David Embury’s 1948 book *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*. If anyone has any further history or background to this drink, I’d love to hear about it in the comments.  

**Recipes**  
*The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks* by David Embury  
* 1 part Bénédictine  
* 2 parts rye whiskey  
* 1 or 2 dashes Angostura bitters  
Shaken on ice, [strained]  

*Bartender’s Choice* [app](http://bartenderschoiceapp.com/wordpress/), created by Sammy Ross and the bartenders at Milk + Honey in NYC  
* 57 mL rye whiskey (~2 oz)  
* 12.5 mL Bénédictine (scant 0.5 oz)  
* 3 dashes Angostura bitters

**Results**  
The Monte Carlo is most often seen as a variation on the Manhattan, where the sweet and herbal component of sweet vermouth is replaced by Bénédictine, and is understandable, especially when strained and served up. Personally, since I take this cocktail on a large rock in an old-fashioned glass, I find this drink to be more closely related to an Old-Fashioned where Bénédictine takes the place of simple syrup while adding an extra dimension of herbal sweetness. It is interesting to note that modern recipes double the amount of rye whiskey from David Embury’s original spec, despite Mr. Embury’s proclivity towards (and sometimes criticized for) spirit-forward drinks.  
The nose of this cocktail is very spicy and aromatic, striking a fine balance between the essential oils from lemon peel and the blend of spices in Angostura bitters. In the mouth, it has a very strong backbone provided by rye whiskey, especially if using one near 100 proof. The initial flavor I detect is a continuation of lemon oil from the nose to the palate, which fades into the honeyed sweetness of Bénédictine, finally transitioning to a blend of the herbal characteristics of Bénédictine and spicy bitterness of Angostura bitters. The Monte Carlo is definitely a strong cocktail suitable for sipping and appreciating the complex spice, fruit, and herbal notes.  

**Variations**  
There are a few variations on the Monte Carlo that I have come across, but as a quietly underappreciated cocktail, I would love to hear if anyone has their own suggestions or variations on it.  
One variation is to substitute Peychaud’s bitters for the Angostura bitters, which would likely take this in a direction somewhere between the [Vieux Carré](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1a8cs5/not_cocktail_of_the_week_10_vieux_carr%C3%A9/) and the [Sazerac](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/14qgow/cocktail_of_the_week_2_sazerac/) with the combination of rye whiskey, Bénédictine, and Peychaud’s bitters.  
Another variation lies in whether it is served up or on the rocks (or rock in my case). Straining the Monte Carlo and serving it up will give it a more Manhattan-esque feel, versus the old-fashioned glass. Personally, as this cocktail is not tempered by the lower proof of sweet vermouth in a Manhattan and is comprised entirely of spirits, I find that it can benefit from the slow dilution from a large ice cube, and so prefer it served in an old-fashioned glass.
Finally, according to the Monte Carlo’s assumed creator, David Embury, this drink was intended to be shaken, not stirred. As is often discussed, this affects the texture and could potentially also affect the taste, though that point is controversial. As I generally follow the rule that drinks without juices are stirred, I’ve never tried a shaken Monte Carlo, but it a variation nonetheless.   

**Ice Cubes and Dilution**  
Since I recently acquired the Tovolo KING ice cube mold and this is the first post featuring a large ice cube, I thought I would take it as an opportunity to have a short section discussing ice, specifically focusing on size and effects on dilution. I believe that the role of ice in a cocktail can be boiled down to two important elements, which are aeration and surface area/volume ratio.   
Aeration is the most obvious effect of ice in a cocktail, and is the result of chilling a cocktail by shaking rather than stirring, resulting in incorporation of tiny air bubbles and shards of ice that affect texture. Some argue that the additional exposure to air results in oxidation, affecting the flavor of a cocktail, but I personally don’t buy that theory, with other factors such as the quality and freshness of your vermouth probably playing a much larger role. The general rule of thumb, as mentioned previously, is that cocktails utilizing juices or other non-alcoholic opaque liquids should be shaken to better incorporate and blend the ingredients together, while cocktails comprised entirely of spirits should be stirred for better control over dilution and presentation.  
A subtler underappreciated, but very important, aspect of ice can be understood by explaining the surface area/volume ratio and the effect it has on ice. To start off, the surface area of a cube of ice can be calculated as the length of one side squared multiplied by six, while the volume is the length of one side cubed. As a result of this, as a cube of ice gets larger, the volume increases disproportionately to the surface area (a slightly more detailed but simple explanation and diagrams can be found [here](http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gross/bioed/bealsmodules/area_volume.html). This has two effects that should be taken into consideration for cocktails. Firstly, smaller cubes of ice will melt more quickly and contribute to diluting a cocktail much quicker as they have a higher amount of surface area relative to volume that comes into contact with liquid. This is the main reason why a large cube or sphere of ice is preferred in cocktails that are served on the rocks, as not only will it stay chilled much longer, but it will not dilute as quickly. Secondly, since smaller cubes of ice have more surface area relative to volume, they will have significantly more water residing on the surface of the cube that will contribute to dilution without significant effect on chilling when preparing a cocktail. In general, it is best to use as large a cube as reasonably possible unless the cocktail specifically calls for crushed/pebbled ice.  
I’ve done my best to summarize the important points to keep in mind regarding ice, but I’ve done a mediocre job compared to the highly recommended explanations that you can find in two parts [here](http://www.cookingissues.com/2010/09/02/cocktail-science-in-general-part-1-of-2/) and [here](http://www.cookingissues.com/2010/09/08/cocktail-science-in-generalpart-2-of-2/) via Dave Arnold of the Cooking Issues blog. 

**Cheers!**  
As always, I am grateful for all the appreciation that you guys show for this regular /r/cocktails feature. Hopefully all of you with a bottle of Bénédictine in your bar will be able to try this cocktail and let me know both if you enjoyed it and how you took it. I’m always appreciative of people volunteering their time to contribute their favorite cocktails to this series to share with everyone, so if you are interested please feel free to send me a message. Finally, I have been asked to include a wishlist for those that want to extend a special gesture of appreciation as I currently do not need more reddit gold, so I have provided a link to my [Amazon cocktail wishlist](http://amzn.com/w/LJIN08K4RTJW) with the many cocktail books I would love to peruse and a few tools. Unfortunately Cocktail Kingdom has no current way of sharing a wishlist, but if you’re more inclined to supporting me with equipment, just ask. Until next week, cheers!
