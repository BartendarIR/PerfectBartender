**Not Cocktail of the Week #53: Alaska**  
Welcome back to your regularly scheduled programming, big thanks to /u/bitcheslovebanjos for taking over for me last week and doing a great job writing about the Astor Hotel Special. This week’s post is going to be relatively abbreviated, as I have just returned from Singapore on Sunday and thus don’t have the usual amount of time for writing. Still, I wanted to share another cocktail using Yellow Chartreuse as I wanted to play some more with my Christmas present. Somehow I came across the Alaska cocktail, a simple classic cocktail that has been described as a variation on a Martini.

**Background**  
Oddly enough, there is very little known about the origins of the Alaska cocktail. The most that people seem to be able to ascertain is that this has nothing to do with Alaska or Eskimos, as seen from the description in *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, and instead is attributed to originating in South Carolina. I’m not sure exactly how that is any explanation for its name though.   

**Recipes**  
*The Savoy Cocktail Book*, Harry Craddock, 1930  
* 3/4 Dry Gin  
* 1/4 Yellow Chartreuse  
Shake well and strain into cocktail glass.  
Note: So far as can be ascertained this delectable potion is NOT the staple diet of the Esquimaux. It was probably first thought of in South Carolina – hence its name.  

*The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*, David Embury, 1948  
* 1 part Yellow Chartreuse  
* 5 to 7 parts Gin  
Stir. A twist of lemon over each drink.  
Note that this is merely a Dry Martini with Chartreuse in place of vermouth. Because of the sweetness of the Chartreuse, a larger proportion of gin may be used than with the Dry Martini. This is also sometimes called the Oriental. It can be greatly improved by using less Chartreuse and adding 1 to 2 parts dry sherry. This is the Nome.  

*The Joy of Mixology*, Gary Regan, 2003  
* 1.5 oz Gin  
* 0.5 oz Yellow Chartreuse  
Stir and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.  
Note: Experiment with ratios when preparing this drink. Chartreuse can easily overpower other ingredients, and it’s vital to consider which brand of gin you are using. Tanqueray, for example, will stand up to more Chartreuse than, say, Bombay will.

**Results**  
While the pictures accompanying this NCotW post are of this drink using Organic Nation gin, I wanted to try this drink with a number of different gins to see how they pair with Yellow Chartreuse, especially after seeing Gary Regan’s note about experimenting with ratios depending on the gin. While I haven’t yet experimented with the ratios yet, here are my tasting notes from a handful of different gins.  
I first started with Organic Nation, as it is a very clean expression of gin with both juniper-forward and citrus notes. This version starts with a balanced sweet lemon and juniper nose. As with all the versions of the Alaska I tried, it has a velvety smooth mouthfeel due to the signification fraction of Yellow Chartreuse in the drink. In terms of its flavor, I first taste the herbal and botanical profile of Chartreuse combining with the aromatic lemon oil, which transitions to the clean juniper profile of gin and its citrus notes enhanced with orange bitters. Ultimately, I found the Alaska to be simple and delicious, yet deceptively strong as it is entirely comprised of spirits.  
I then wanted to try an Alaska with Tanqueray Malacca which is a much milder expression of gin, with very subtle juniper notes, instead more dominated by warm spices. I thought this would be interesting in combination with the complex profile of Yellow Chartreuse. This Alaska lacks the juniper notes in the nose, instead dominated by lemon. As previously mentioned, the mouthfeel is similar, very smooth and silky. Flavor-wise, it is a much smoother experience as it lacks the sharp bite of juniper, resulting in a seamless transition between the initial Yellow Chartreuse flavor to Tanqueray Malacca gin. I also noted that I felt the finish had a more pronounced bitterness, perhaps due to some interplay between the spices of the gin and those in the orange bitters. While this version was still enjoyable, I regretted that the Yellow Chartreuse overpowered the gin in this case, so its unique profile was lost among all those botanical notes.   
Moving on from the mild Tanqueray Malacca, I thought an older style of gin that is moderate in its juniper and more citrusy would be well-suited in an Alaska, so I tried a version with Plymouth gin, in this case omitting the orange bitters. The nose of this lay somewhere between the first two versions, still lemony but with a slight juniper note. In this case, I think the citrus of the gin enhanced the lemon character a bit, as I noted a stronger lemon flavor in the cocktail. Oddly enough, using Plymouth gin seemed to mute some of the flavor of Chartreuse and resulted in something that magically resembled a dry Martini. The sweetness and herbal profile of Yellow Chartreuse were no longer up front, instead lying quietly in the background. I can’t quite figure out how this happened, but if it repeats, I can better understand how David Embury describes this as a variation on the Martini.  
Finally, I did a bonus variation with genever, despite *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, specifying dry gin. There are definitely mistakes in the venerated tome (see the background on the [Twelve Mile Limit](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1s3ub4/not_cocktail_of_the_week_48_twelve_mile_limit/) for a specific example), so I thought using genever, which was more common at the time, would be interesting. The funky nose of genever is immediately apparent in this Alaska, which while very unique, does pair well with lemon aromatics. I was pleasantly surprised by its flavor, which maintains the distinct character of each ingredient, while blending together quite well. I felt that the unique profile of genever complements the initial botanical hit of Yellow Chartreuse very well and would definitely try more combinations of genever and Yellow Chartreuse in the future. If you have genever on hand, definitely try this variant and see what you think compared to its stated recipe with gin. 

**Cheers!**  
Here’s to another great year of NCotW! I still can’t believe I’ve been doing this for over a year now, time really flew by. I seem to have more interest from people doing guest posts, so I’m hoping to have at least one each month which will give me more opportunities to discover new cocktails, explore on my own, and have some breaks from writing. If you’re interested in contributing to this little feature on /r/cocktails, send me a message. Don’t be intimidated by my wordy posts, as a guest post you can write it in whatever style you want as long as the content is covered. Other than that, your comments and support continue to be appreciated. If you’ve been enjoying this feature for the last year and it’s introduced you to some new favorite cocktails, show your appreciation with a little reddit gold, which is set to expire for me later this month. Regardless, I’ll be back again next week with another installment, but until then, cheers!
