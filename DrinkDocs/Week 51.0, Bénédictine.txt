**Not Cocktail of the Week #51: Widow’s Kiss**  
Merry Christmas everybody! While it is Christmas and most of you should be busy celebrating Christmas with your families, here you are instead on reddit, reading /r/cocktails and your weekly fix of NCotW. This is the first year I’ve been away from my family for Christmas, electing to fulfill my marital commitment by spending it with my wife. It’s kind of tough, but people still get sick on Christmas and need a doctor to take care of them, so let’s all be grateful that we are not spending Christmas in the hospital. At least she was willing to let me crack open the bottle of Yellow Chartreuse she got me so that I could share this rather ominously named cocktails that we both enjoy, the Widow’s Kiss.

**Background**  
According to cocktail historian David Wondrich, the Widow’s Kiss cocktail was concocted by George J. Kappeler, a well-known bartender at the Holland House hotel in New York City. Wondrich describes Kappeler as having “a true artist’s combination of effortless command of detail and willingness to transcend petty rules”, with the Widow’s Kiss being a perfect example of this. In the Widow’s Kiss, Kappeler successfully combines three very flavorful, assertive, and disparate ingredients which Wondrich describes as “highly pungent and aromatic herbal tonics” into a complex enjoyable cocktail.  First found in Kappeler’s own 1895 book, *Modern American Drinks*, it remained popular enough to be included in the tome of classic cocktails, *The Savoy Cocktail Book*. After that, it seems to have vanished into relative obscurity for a while as I couldn’t find mention of it in the 1948 *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*, but that could be because the Widow’s Kiss was not to David Embury’s taste. More recently, the Widow’s Kiss was revived by Ted Haigh in *Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails* and has since been included in *The PDT Cocktail Book*.

A few notes on the methodology for the Widow’s Kiss via David Wondrich. Firstly, despite many esteemed individuals suggesting the use of Green Chartreuse if Yellow is not available, such as Robert Hess in the video above or Erik Ellestad from Savoy Stomp, David Wondrich emphatically states in *Imbibe!*, “If you can only get Green Chartreuse, make something else: The green is an entirely different product, and far too concentrated to work here.” In a similar vein, he states with respect to the Benedictine, “Do not substitute B&B for Benedictine. This drink is a balancing act, and if one thing is out of whack, everything is.” Finally, he adds an interesting note suggesting that this drink actually be shaken despite being comprised entirely of spirits. From his extensive research and knowledge he says, “Normally, a drink like this should be stirred. But Kappeler says to shake, and since he’s not once of those ‘I shake everything’ types, I’m inclined to follow his advice.” I figure David Wondrich knows a lot more about these things than me, so I dutifully followed his advice to the letter.  
The Widow’s Kiss cocktail is a great after-dinner sipping cocktail, full of lush fruit, sweet honey, and complex herbs. In the nose, I primarily get a heady aroma of juicy apple from the apple brandy with a deep herbal note lurking behind its sweet façade. Upon sipping, I first get the apple notes up front followed by the sweet honey of Benedictine and finishing with the distinctive herbal profile of Chartreuse. The bitter herbs from the Yellow Chartreuse, Benedictine and Angostura bitters linger on the palate after sipping, but I am unable to pick out any specific notes within the finish other than it provides a great contrast between sips. Without the complex herbal and bitter notes, the sweetness of this drink would be overwhelming. It has a very full-bodied texture and thick mouthfeel due to liqueurs making up a significant fraction of this drink. As the drink warms up slightly over time, the herbal notes become more and more apparent, which makes an interesting progression from a cocktail that is first sweet with herbal notes into one that is more herbal with honey notes.  
Over the course of a few minutes, the cloudiness from shaking dissipates, which makes me question why shaking it is so imperative. I hypothesize it is to speed up the inclusion of water into this cocktail, as its ingredients are quite strong and would probably be overly sweet without sufficient water to dilute it. Perhaps a very thorough stirring might be sufficient. Additionally, if prepared this way, I would also serve it on a large ice cube to aid with the dilution, though by doing this, you would lose the flavor shift of this cocktail as it warms. Maybe David Wondrich is right and a good shake could be the best.

**Yellow Chartreuse**  
I previously wrote a piece on the background and history of Benedictine in my NCotW post on the [Montgomery Smith](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/17kqvh/not_cocktail_of_the_week_4_montgomery_smith/) and a similar piece on Green Chartreuse in the NCotW for the [Final Ward](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1d3j41/not_cocktail_of_the_week_16_final_ward/), so if you want to learn more about those ingredients, check out my old posts. Here I will just briefly go over some of the differences of Yellow Chartreuse from Green Chartreuse since I’ve already previously covered its history. Compared to Green Chartreuse at 110 proof, Yellow Chartreuse is generally a much milder, clocking in at a respectable 80 proof. Both are made from a secret combination of 130 herbs, plants, and flowers, but Yellow Chartreuse also has the inclusion of honey and saffron. Despite the popularity of Green Chartreuse today, some propose that Yellow Chartreuse is what was used in the cocktails found in *The Savoy Cocktail Book*. They have a relatively similar flavor profile, very herbal, very vegetal, but Yellow Chartreuse is milder and sweeter. I would consider Green Chartreuse to be indispensable for those putting together an advanced bar, with Yellow being an optional addition for those that want a little more flexibility and options when working with Chartreuse. While I’m no expert, they have a similar character and considering their price, having both is a luxury.

**Cheers!**  
Merry Christmas to all my faithful readers! While not much of a Christmas-themed cocktail, perhaps you will find room for the Widow’s Kiss in your near future. If you need something more Christmas-themed, check out the last couple weeks of NCotW and make some fresh Eggnog, enjoy your aged Eggnog, or make a Hot Milk Punch to ward off the chill. If you have any questions or comments, leave them below, but otherwise, I wish you all a Merry Christmas! Cheers!
