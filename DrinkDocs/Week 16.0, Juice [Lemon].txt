**Not Cocktail of the Week #16: Final Ward**  
Sorry for the late post, I forgot to get pictures off the camera yesterday. For the monthly modern cocktail featured in my NCotW column, I’ll share a little about the Final Ward, a well-known variant on the famously delicious Last Word cocktail which /u/DrammingSpeed wrote up as the first of three Cocktail of the Week features [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/14c11h/cocktail_of_the_week_1_last_word/) that that inspired my series. 

**Background**  
This is a variation on the Last Word cocktail, a cocktail that originated in the 1920s in the Detroit Athletic Club, before being published in Bottom’s Up! by Ted Saucier in 1951. It fell off the radar until 2004, when Murray Stenson, who seemingly single-handedly developed the cocktail scene in my hometown of Seattle, came across the Last Word and began serving it at his first joint, Zig Zag Café. My visits to Zig Zag, and the other bars he helped develop (RN74 and Canon among many) played a formative role in my love of cocktails today. The Last Word cocktail is my go to drink when I have visitors that have no idea what they want to drink, as it is a supremely balanced cocktail whose ingredients meld together very well, yielding a cocktail containing both the familiar (gin + lime) and exciting unknowns (maraschino and green chartreuse). It also helps that it is incredibly easy to remember, comprised of equal parts of each ingredient.  
The Final Ward cocktail is a variation on the Last Word that substitutes rye whiskey and lemon juice in place of the original gin and lime. This is a great example of what seems to be a very simple and straightforward substitution, but because of its thoughtfulness, has become established as a well-known cocktail in its own right. It was conceived of by the famed bartender Phil Ward of Death + Company, a highly regarded cocktail bar in New York City. Its name is obviously derived from the Last Word, comprised of half synonym (Last:Final), and half homonym (Word:Ward), that may give a slight nod to the Ward 8 cocktail that also calls for rye whiskey.  

**Recipes**  
* 0.75 oz rye whiskey  
* 0.75 oz lemon juice

**Results**  
If you ever get tired of drinking a Last Word, or can’t stand the taste of gin, this is a refreshing change of pace. The aroma of the Final Ward is very similar to that of a Last Word. I would have a hard time distinguishing them blindfolded as they both primarily smell of the combination of green chartreuse and maraschino liqueur. The Final Ward is well-balanced with a thoughtful progression of flavors. I would describe its texture as full bodied due to the strong backbone provided by rye whiskey. It initially is a slightly sweet and spicy cocktail, from the combination of rye with the two liqueurs, but proceeds to the sour note of the lemon which pairs well with whiskey, and finishes with the woody notes of maraschino combining with the herbal notes of green chartreuse. Much like a Last Word, the Final Ward is a cocktail that goes by all too quickly (perhaps I should just start using a 1 oz. pour of each). 

**Variations**  
There are a few more lesser-known variations on the Last Word that are worth mentioning here. Substituting a smoky Islay scotch has been mentioned or suggested to me in the past, but I have not tried it since I don’t have any in my cabinet as I am not a big fan of Islay scotch yet. Somewhat in the same vein, I also remember seeing mezcal in place of gin, which might be more palatable, also something I do not have in my cabinet unfortunately. I came across a few other suggestions at this link [here](http://cold-glass.com/2011/04/01/the-last-word-with-an-asterisk-variations-on-a-classic-cocktail/), which suggests cognac + lemon as a delicious sounding alternative, or rhum agricole + lime. If anyone has the means to try any of these out, please report back with results. In any case, the basic formula of this cocktail do invite some experimentation with different base spirits + citrus. Perhaps more experimentation with different citrus would be interesting. Grapefruit and tequila in the vein of that Paloma cocktail I saw posted recently? I might have to try that when I have the chance.  

**Green Chartreuse**  
As part of my weekly feature, I like to do a little research and educate myself on a particular aspect of the featured cocktail, which hopefully benefits you guys as well. This week I thought it would be interesting to learn more about Green Chartreuse.  
Although their flavor and colors are completely different, the story behind Green Chartreuse shares a lot in common with Bénédictine. Both hail from France, were made by monks, and are based off a recipe for the “elixir of life”. Chartreuse, which originally was only made in the green variety, is based off of a recipe from 1605 by Peres Chartreux for an “Elixir of Long Life” that was gifted to Carthusian monks by François Hannibal d'Estrées, a marshal of artillery to French king Henry IV.  
As a liqueur with over 400 years of history, the story behind Green Chartreuse is marked by difficulties and interesting history. For the first hundred years or so, only parts of the recipe were understood and used at the monastery in Vauvert. Eventually in 1737, the complex recipe for this “Elixir” was brought to the Mother House of the Order, La Grande Chartreuse, where the apothecary Frère Jerome Maubec studied and standardized the recipe. Interestingly, this specific product is still produced and sold to this day as Elixir Vegetal de la Grande-Chartreuse, which you may recall from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/19a5bf/elixir_vegetal/) post on /r/cocktails from 2 months ago. This original recipe, at 138 proof, was very intense, and in 1764, the Carthusian monks adapted the original recipe to make a milder and more palatable version that we recognize as Green Chartreuse today. 
Following the French Revolution in 1789 (I’m so bad at history I didn’t realize and was amazed to learn that Green Chartreuse existed prior to that vaguely familiar event from history class), when religious orders were ordered to leave the country, the monks left a copy of the recipe in the monastery which was recovered upon their return after several years. In 1838, the monks developed what is now known as Yellow Chartreuse, colored with saffron, with distinct flavors of citrus, violet, and honey. The monks were again evicted from their homes in 1903, following the nationalization of their distillery, and moved to Spain. By 1929, France had sold the trademark “Chartreuse” to a group of distillers that set up the "Compagnie Fermière de la Grande Chartreuse" which soon went bankrupt. Friends of the Carthusian monks bought the shares of the company, regaining the trademark, and gifting it back to the monks. They were then finally able to return to their original home and distillery in Fourvoire, at least for a few years. Unfortunately, a landslide in 1935 nearly destroyed their distillery, forcing them to move yet again to a new facility in Voiron, where Green Chartreuse is still made to this day.  
As is the case for distinctive products reliant on a secret recipe, the recipe for Green Chartreuse is known only by 2 monks at a time. It calls for macerating over 130 herbs, plants, and flowers found in the French Alps in neutral alcohol spirit before distillation and aging for 5 years in oak, one of many reasons it is unique among other liqueurs. The resulting spirit, bottled at surprisingly high 110 proof, is intensely herbal with notes of cloves, citrus, thyme, rosemary, and cinnamon. You can find more information on their official website [here](http://www.chartreuse.fr/index.php?lang=uk&accueil=1), which is surprisingly not even on the first page of Google when searching for “green chartreuse”. I also dug up a decent recipe for Chartreuse in Pierre Duplais’ *A Treatise on the Manufacture and Distillation of Alcoholic Liquors* found [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=li8tAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA474#v=onepage&q&f=false) should anyone have the courage to give it a try.
Closing trivia fact: Green Chartreuse is the only spirit with a color named after it.
