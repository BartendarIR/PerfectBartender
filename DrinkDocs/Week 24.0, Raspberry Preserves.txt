**Not Cocktail of the Week #24: Clover Club**  
I will admit that I had originally planned to do the very old Improved Whiskey cocktail this week to contrast with the modern beer cocktail of last week, but upon making a Clover Club this weekend with the fresh raspberries that are now in season, I simply had to write about this cocktail as it was so delicious that upon tasting I literally sat in awe and devoured this cocktail in the span of a few minutes. It doesn’t hurt that despite its relative unpopularity, it is a venerable classic cocktail in its own right with a lot of history.

**Background**  
The Clover Club is another one of those underappreciated classic cocktails that I seem to love writing about. It is named after the Philadelphia gentlemen’s club comprised of journalists, lawyers, businessmen, and socialites that met at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia from the 1880s until the 1920s. They are described in *The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book* by Albert Stevens Crockett, they are described as:
> “[meeting in the] old Belleview-Stratford, where the Clover Club, composed of literary, legal, financial and business lights of the Quaker City, often dined and wined, and wined again.”

Though it predates the actual Algonquin Round Table, some people have described the Clover Club in the same vein. It may be worth briefly noting that the term gentlemen’s club in this context refers to a members-only (and usually men-only) private club that brings to mind the image of dark and wood-paneled place of gathering for the cigar-smoking, whiskey-drinking, and gambling men of industry, rather than the connotation of a strip club that it carries today.  
The Clover Club cocktail is first documented in William Boothby’s 1908 *The World’s Drinks and How to Mix Them*, but is more usually attributed for being in Albert Stevens Crockett’s 1931 *Old Waldorf Bar Days*. The Clover Club cocktail likely traveled with George Charles Boldt as he went from owner of the Bellevue Hotel in 1888, the original host of the Clover Club in 1881, to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in 1890, finally returning to Philadelphia in 1904 to open the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel. The role of the Clover Club, presumably the gentlemen’s club rather than the cocktail, played a significant role in his life, as he went so far as to give his daughter the middle name Clover.   
The drinker of the Clover Club is originally characterized by Jack Townsend in his 1951 *The Bartender’s Book* as:
> … traditionally a gentleman of the pre-Prohibition school. He may not necessarily be one of the legal, literary, or business figures who were members of the club of that name. He may never have been in the bar of the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia where the Clover Club members foregathered and the drink originated. But he belongs with that set.  

Despite these gentlemanly origins, in 1934, Esquire magazine lampooned the Clover Club cocktail, featuring it as one of the ten worst cocktails, and later in 1949, as included in their *Handbook for Hosts* in the section “Something for Girls”. This stems from the close relation of the Clover Club cocktail to the Pink Lady, which really does sound like something for girls, and whose drinking was characterized as:
> … that nice little girl who works in files, who’s always so courteous but always seems so timid. She’s the one who sort of reminds you of your aunt, the quiet one. Naturally, you never expected to see her at a bar. She gets into one about twice a year, at Christmas time or some other high old time. Just why she picks the Pink Lady for these occasions–since the Lady packs quite a wallop–remains a mystery, even to her perhaps. It’s quite possible she has seen the decorative and innocuous-appearing pink-and-white amalgamation passing on a waiter’s tray and decided, “Hmmm, that couldn’t do me any harm.”

Unfortunately, the blurring lines between the Pink Lady and the Clover Club eventually resulted in the Clover Club being co-opted as a woman’s drink since it is pink, fruity, and fluffy. Still, we should keep in mind its origins as the signature drink of a classic gentlemen’s club and perhaps take it as a lesson that stereotyping drinks as “manly” or “girly” doesn’t really make much sense and honestly does more harm than good. Luckily, the Clover Club has had a bit of resurgence in popularity with the modern cocktail renaissance revisiting and rediscovering classic pre-prohibition cocktails. In fact, the well-regarded [Clover Club cocktail bar](http://www.cloverclubny.com/) in New York City went so far as to name themselves after it.

**Results**  
I went with the Bartender’s Choice app recipe, as I’ve had a lot of success with their recipes suiting my taste, though I was shocked that the recipe asks for 5 oz of raspberries in the process of weighing them out I estimated that it was asking for ~30 raspberries. A little quick googling revealed other recipes utilizing fresh raspberries use 5-6 raspberries, so I concluded that the “oz” was unintentionally appended. The original recipe for the Clover Club calls for raspberry syrup, probably prepared by cooking raspberries in simple syrup, which slowly transformed into grenadine as it was probably more easily available in the bar. I would strongly recommend using raspberries if available to do this cocktail justice. I elected to use some Tanqueray Malacca for this, as I felt its softer and more restrained character of citrus and spice would meld beautifully in this classic cocktail, though as presented in *The PDT Cocktail Book*, Plymouth gin works well, and I expect Hendrick’s would also be well-suited in a Clover Club.  
Upon tasting it I simply exclaimed, “Wow!” which I think speaks a lot to how delicious this cocktail is. The best way to describe the nose of this cocktail is perfume-y, with fresh botanical and fruity aromas being slowly released by the emulsified egg whites. The flavor of fresh raspberry is very notable, blending seamlessly with the gin and sweetly balancing with the tartness of lemon juice. As with drinks incorporating egg white, the texture is very smooth with a slight creaminess, which gives this drink a dessert-like characteristic. I could barely even tell that I was having a cocktail, as its flavors blended incredibly well. Ultimately, this cocktail left me literally speechless and frantically trying to scribble down tasting notes before I finished it. I will definitely be offering this cocktail to guests when I have the luxury of fresh raspberries, as it is sophisticated enough to impress, but approachable enough to be appealing to a wide audience.

**Variations**  
As seen in the classic recipe, grenadine or raspberry syrup instead of fresh raspberries are traditionally used in the Clover Club. However, I haven’t replenished my grenadine yet, so if anybody doesn’t have access to fresh raspberries, feel free to give it a shot with grenadine and share how it turns out in the comments. As seen in *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, it might be worth trying it with lime juice rather than lemon, but honestly I enjoyed the original recipe so much I can’t really justify playing with the recipe. There are a couple other variations in *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, the Clover Leaf, which adds a mint garnish, the Royal Clover Club which substitutes an egg yolk for the egg white, and the Grand Royal Clover Club which forgoes separating the egg and uses it in its entirety.

**Cheers!**
