**Not Cocktail of the Week #69: Mint Julep**
 
The Kentucky Derby is around the corner which means the nation will be flooded with Mint Juleps this upcoming weekend! What better time to look back on the history of this classic cocktail and the proper methods to make one at home. Will be out of pocket later today so posting a bit earlier than normal, especially for you West Coasters.
 
**Background**
 
The Mint Julep has a long and exhausting history as one of the earliest cocktails. The term “Julep” can be traced as far back as 10th century Persian (“gulab”), translated as “Rose Water”. Water was barely drinkable this far back in history and roses were probably used to enhance the flavor of water. It is believed that rose petals were replaced sometime in the 1700s with the more medicinal use of mint. The first written mention of mint as an ingredient of the julep came from, “Travel of Four Years and a Half in the United States“, by John Davies, 1803.
 
Jerry Thomas claims the Mint Julep originated from the Southern States of America, and eventually spread by Capt. Marryatt, skipper and novelist, who introduced the beverage into the British Isles. Capt. Marryatt wrote *“There are many varieties such as those composed of Claret, Madeira. etc., but the ingredients of the real mint julep are as follows. I learned how to make them, and succeeded pretty well. Put into a tumbler almost a dozen sprigs of the tender shoots of mint. Upon them put a spoonful of white sugar, and equal proportions of Peach and common Brandy so as to fill it up one-third, or perhaps a little less. Then take rasped or pounded ice, and fill up the tumbler. Rub the lips of the tumbler with a piece of fresh pineapple, and the tumbler itself is very often encrusted outside with stalactites of ice.”* He claimed that the Mint Julep was as irresistible as American women!
 
Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky is famous for spreading the popularity of the Mint Julep as his drink of choice at the Willard Hotel’s Round Robin Bar in Washington, DC (I have had the pleasure of drinking Juleps at the Willard). Taken from Senator Clay’s diary, the Mint Julep recipe was as follows:
 
> "The mint leaves fresh and tender, should be pressed against the goblet with the back of a silver spoon. Only bruise the leaves gently and then remove them from the goblet. Half fill with cracked ice. Mellow bourbon, aged in oaken barrels, is poured from the jigger and allowed to slide slowly through the cracked ice. In another receptacle, granulated sugar is slowly mixed with chilled limestone water to make a silvery mixture as smooth as some rare Egyptian oil, then poured on top of the ice. While beads of moisture gather on the burnished exterior of the silver goblet, garnish the brim of the goblet with choicest sprigs of mint."
 
**Recipes**
 
*The Savoy Cocktail Book, Harry Craddock, 1930*
 
* 4 sprigs fresh mint
* ½ tbls powdered sugar
* 1 glass bourbon, rye, or Canadian whisky
 
Use long tumbler and crush mint leaves and dissolved sugar lightly together. Add spirits and fill glass with cracked ice. Stir gently until glass is frosted. Decorate on top with 3 sprigs of mint.
 
*Dave Wondrich, Esquire*
 
* 10 sprigs mint
* 1 tsp of sugar
* 1 oz spring water
* 3 oz bourbon
 
Combine mint, sugar, and water. Lightly macerate. Let stand for 10-15 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve into glass filled with crushed ice. Add whiskey. Stir briskly until glass frosts. Top with more ice. Garnish with mint.
 
*Dushan Zaric, Employees Only, New York*
 
* 2 ounces Maker’s Mark
* 1 brown sugar cube
* 1 white sugar cube
* 3 dashes of Angostura bitters
* 1 dash of Peychaud’s bitters
* Splash of soda
 
Crush the sugar with the bitters and soda in the bottom of a julep cup. Add a handful of fresh clean mint leaves (no stalks). Using a muddle, gently tap the mint for about 20 seconds for the leaves to release essence (please do not turn into something that resembles a pesto). Fill cup with crushed ice and add your bourbon. Using a bar spoon, blend and stir - the ice will dilute – top with more crushed ice and crown with a big mint garnish.
 
*Jeffrey Morgenthaler*
 
* 12 mint sprigs
* ¼-1/2 oz simple syrup
* 2 oz bourbon
 
In the bottom of a 10-12 oz glass, or julep cup, gently muddle mint and simple syrup. Add bourbon. Stir to combine. Fill glass with crushed ice. Garnish with the prettiest mint sprig you can find.
 
**Results**
 
The base spirit chosen for your Julep will play a big part in the final product but it doesn’t necessarily need to be an expensive bottle. Personally, I typically tend to prefer a rye based value bourbon with at least 100 proof (VOB BIB, JW Dant BIB, OGD BIB, etc). I think that the spiciness from the rye balances better with the sugar and mint than a typically softer and sweeter wheat based bourbon. With that said I’ve been known to use Weller Antique 107 from time to time.
 
The first sip is assertive, fresh, and crisp. As the ice melts and the extra simple syrup seeps into the cocktail it gradually becomes more balanced and refreshing. A heavy mint garnish is important to ensure that you get a big nose-full of fresh mint with every sip.  Probably more important than the vessel (but only marginally), is the crushed ice. Using crushed ice keeps the Julep ice cold with just the right amount of dilution. If you don’t have a Lewis Bag (or old bank bag in my case), you can also use a shaker tin with a muddler or a food processer to get fresh dry crushed ice. For me, there isn’t much I love more on a hot day than a proper Julep.
 
**Variations**
 
The majority of current day Mint Juleps are primarily made with bourbon but historically they may have also been drank with cognac, brandy, rum, gin, genever, or rye. Sometimes even combinations therein. Try different base spirits and see what you personally prefer.
 
The Smash is basically an open ended variation of the Mint Julep. It is in effect a Mint Julep with the addition of various fruits and/or herbs. Similarly, the base spirit is interchangeable. One of my favorite Smash recipes uses fresh cherries in season muddled with lemon and combined with honey syrup, mint, and whiskey.
 
**The Mint**
 
Harold McGee, in an article for Lucky Peach, talks about how to get the best flavor out of herbs. He notes, “Herbs and spices can make foods delicious, but they’re usually not delicious in themselves, because plants don’t want animals to chew up their leaves and seeds and roots…most herb and spice flavors are actually chemical weapons.”
 
He continues, “How you handle herbs can also affect their flavor. The defensive chemicals responsible for plant flavors are usually concentrated in fine, hairlike glands on leaf surfaces (the mint family, including basil, oregano, sage, shiso, and thyme) or in special canals within the leaves (most other herbs). If you leave the herbs pretty much intact, what you get is mainly the characteristic flavor of that herb. But if you crush the herb, or cut it very finely, you damage a lot of cells and cause the release of the green, grassy, vegetal defensive chemicals.”
 
All that to say…be gentle with your mint! Wake it up. Caress it. Fondle it. But don’t muddle it to death!
 
**Conclusion**
 
I believe Lt. General Simon Bolivar, 1937, may have said it best, *“A mint julep is not a product of a formula. It is a ceremony and must be performed by a gentleman possessing a true sense of the artistic; a deep reverence for the ingredients and a proper appreciation of the occasion.”* There are many ways to make a Mint Julep. I make them differently all the time. Play around with different base spirits, various proportions of mint and sugar and figure out what works best for you. Cheers.
