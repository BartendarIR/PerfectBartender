**Not Cocktail of the Week #3: Corpse Reviver #2**

So my goal for this column is to roughly feature the following each month: 2 classic drinks, 1 simple drink, and 1 modern drink. So far I’ve written up the classic [Bobby Burns]( http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/169jv7/cocktail_of_the_week_3_bobby_burns/) and the deceptively simple [Manhattan]( http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/16pciv/not_cocktail_of_the_week_2_the_manhattan/) cocktail. This week I return to a classic cocktail, the Corpse Reviver #2. Given the lengthy treatise on the Manhattan cocktail last week, this week’s post will be briefer. 

**Background**  
I really wonder what it would have been like to live in an era where having a couple of these at breakfast to “revive you”, aka fight off last night’s hangover, would have been like. The Corpse Reviver #2 is the most well-known of the Corpse Reviver “series” of cocktails, though I have not come across any solid existence of a #3. This is another classic cocktail that has enjoyed its own namesake revival of late in cocktail bars.

**Results**  
This is a very refreshing cocktail, not bracingly sour as many classic cocktail recipes seem to be. Thanks to the absinthe rinse, you get a herbaceous sweet aroma which gives way to a well-balanced fruity and sour cocktail. It is definitely a cocktail that keeps inviting you back for another sip.

**Variations**  
There are a couple interesting variations on the classic Corpse Reviver #2 that I have encountered, the first of which is to increase the amount of absinthe present, as tested by [Kaiser Penguin](http://www.kaiserpenguin.com/recipe-comparison-corpse-reviver-2/). In my experience, the absinthe in the original recipe seems to only contribute to the aroma of the cocktail, so adding some anise flavor could contribute to some pleasant complexity, though I would be cautious of overdoing it.   	
Another variation that I’ve had the pleasure of enjoying is a barrel-aged Corpse Reviver #2. Though hard to remember the exact experience, I remember that it resulted in a sweeter and mellower cocktail likely due to the lemon juice losing its bite. In addition, because of the exposure to wood, its color had changed from white to a pleasant light brown. Though not true of all barrel-aged cocktails, this version is definitely something worth trying if you are lucky enough to come across it. 

**Lillet**  
Lillet is a fortified wine, similar to dry vermouth, made from a blend of Bordeaux wines (Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon and Muscadelle) to which citrus liqueurs (made from sweet orange and bitter orange peels) and quinine, the bittering agent present in tonic water, are added. It is actually a rather delicious aperitif, suitable for drinking before dinner on ice. The original Lillet used in many of the cocktail recipes found in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* call for Kina Lillet. Unfortunately, this product no longer exists as the company that produces Lillet decided to reformulate it in 1986 and rename it Lillet Blanc, which is intended to be “fresher, fruitier, and less bitter”. An alternative Lillet is Cocchi Apertivo Americano, which is reported to be closer to the original Kina Lillet than Lillet Blanc. As I haven’t yet gone through my bottle of Lillet Blanc, I cannot verify this claim, but perhaps more educated folk could report in. 

**Cheers!**  
Note: Four of these taken in swift succession will unrevive the corpse again. (quoted from *The Savoy Cocktail Book*)
