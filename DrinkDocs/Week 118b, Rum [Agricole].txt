**Not Cocktail of the Week #118: Pineapple Daiquiri & Pineapple Express**  
Having already covered bar tools/equipment for my first cakeday post ([Cakeday Special - Equipment](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1j24ii/not_cocktail_of_the_week_29_cakeday_special_home/)) and bar books for my second cakeday post ([Cakeday Special - Books](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2bq7v9/not_cocktail_of_the_week_81_cakeday_special/)), I was at a bit of a loss as to what to post for my third cakeday. To commemorate this cakeday, I decided to do a double feature on a fabulous new ingredient that I think we’ll see a lot more of in the near future, Plantation “Stiggin’s Fancy” pineapple rum.  
**Background**  
In lieu of any background on the two cocktails I’ll be sharing, for this special feature I will instead share the background of the featured ingredient, Plantation “Stiggin’s Fancy” pineapple rum. This special product debuted at Tales of the Cocktail (TotC) last year in 2014 as a special project between David Wondrich and Maison Ferrand, who produce the entire Plantation line of rum along with Pierre Ferrand Cognac, Pierre Ferrand dry curacao and Citadelle gin.  
Since most flavored spirits are generally quite vile and carry negative connotations, one can imagine the hesitation associated with producing a pineapple-infused rum. While we generally accept fresh infusions as a craft product, we similarly deride the artificially infused vodkas and rums that have no place in classic cocktails. Much to my surprise, according to esteemed cocktail historian David Wondrich, pineapple rum existed and was enjoyed since the 1800s with a recipe found in the *English Journal of Patent and Inventions* in 1824 and referenced again in the *Journal of Agricultural Society* in 1844. The name “Stiggin’s Fancy” is in reference to Reverend Stiggins, a character in Charles Dickens’ *Pickwick Papers* (published from 1836-1837) who enjoyed drinking “reeking hot pine-apple rum-and-water, with a slice of lemon in it”. With these concrete references, it seems clear that pineapple rum existed some time ago and disappeared from our drinking culture until now.  
In order to make traditional pineapple-infused rum, one first needs to decide on a pineapple to use. Alexandre Gabriel, president and owner of Maison Ferrand, spend 3 months trying different pineapples on a daily basis to find one suitable for this product. He settled on the Queen Victoria pineapple, a small varietal that is particularly sweet, more aromatic and juicier than the average pineapple. Rather than transport them by sea as is typically done, he decided to bring the pineapples in by air in to use them at peak freshness. Following the 1824 recipe, the pineapples were peeled by hand and the rinds macerated in 110 proof Plantation 3-star for 8 weeks then redistilled in a pot still to produce a strong pineapple essence. Meanwhile, Plantation original dark rum was infused with the juicy flesh for 3 months. These two infusions were then blended together and aged in used Cognac casks, as is typical for Plantation rums, with a medium toast for 2-3 months.  
Originally intended as a one-off exclusive for participants of TotC 2014, only 1000 bottles (or 600 depending on source) were produced and dedicated to the TotC Apprentice program. The original bottle has a blurb from Alexandre Gabriel and David Wondrich:  
> “David and I did this project in part out of sheer curiosity. Mostly, however, we did it because the pineapple is the symbol of hospitality and also the symbol of the Tales of the Cocktail Apprentice program. Stiggins Fancy is our liquid “thank you” to the Tales Apprentices who do so much for all of us. We hope you all enjoy drinking it as much as we did making it.  The 1824 Journal of Patent Inventions notes that it was customary in the West Indies to offer pineapple rum to visiting European friends. Following the West Indian tradition, Plantation Pineapple Rum is our gift to you.”

The resulting rum turned out to be incredibly popular and beloved by bartenders, quickly becoming highly coveted and rare. To the relief of many, Maison Ferrand eventually figured out a way to make this labor-intensive rum fiscally viable and have produced 6,000 bottles this year for the US market with plans to increase production to 36,000 bottles twice a year in the future.

**Pineapple Daiquiri**  
Just a simple Daiquiri here with my preferred ratio. Feel free to make one to your own spec.  
* 2 oz Plantation “Stiggin’s Fancy” pineapple rum  
* 1 oz lime juice  
* 0.75 oz cane sugar simple syrup  
Shake with ice, strain, garnish with a lime wheel  

*Results*  
This is everything I want a dark rum Daiquiri to be. This drink starts with a delicious bouquet of fresh cut pineapple, a touch of bright lime and a hint of dark rum. In the mouth it has a pleasant full-bodied texture. The initial flavor is of juicy pineapple balanced with tart lime, which transitions to sweet dark rum for the body and finishes with the floral aspects of pineapple on the palate. Despite the pineapple flavor permeating throughout this drink, I agree with Dave Wondrich’s assessment that this does not overwhelm you with pineapple flavor, but is instead a rum first with pineapple notes rounding it out and making it extra delicious.

**Pineapple Express**  
This recipe comes from the New York Times article and was created by Freddie Sarkis of the Broken Shaker in Chicago.  
* 1.5 oz Plantation “Stiggin’s Fancy” pineapple rum  
* 0.75 oz 100 proof rhum agricole, preferably Neisson [no specification for blanc or ambre though…]  
* 0.75 oz lime juice  
* 0.5 oz simple syrup  
Shake with ice, strain into coupe glass, squeeze grapefruit twist over drink and discard.   

*Results*  
In comparison to the Pineapple Daiquiri, this cocktail still starts with fruity pineapple in the nose, though much more aromatic and brighter due to the grapefruit twist. I was surprised at how much of an effect the grapefruit twist had on the drink as a whole and worried that it would clash with pineapple, but it is already apparent from the aroma that these two flavors complement each other very well. On paper, this is less sweet and drier than the previous Pineapple Daiquiri. Unsurprisingly, this is true also in the mouth, but it is still a delicious and well-balanced drink. This cocktail has more citrus flavor up front and much less pineapple character. The body of this cocktail has a much stronger rum note and I was surprised to taste the grassy character of rhum agricole here considering its relatively small contribution and relatively subtle flavor. I attribute this to the grapefruit twist somehow amplifying this flavor. The finish is dry with molasses and bitter grapefruit oils in particular. While this cocktail has an incredible facsimile of fresh pineapple in the nose, it is much more subtle in the flavor compared to the Pineapple Daiquiri. 

**Cheers!**  
Happy cakeday to me, hope you’ve enjoyed this edition of NCotW. If you’re in the US, I highly recommend seeking out this fantastic product, making one of the cocktails above, and enjoying it this summer. If you need help finding it, you can order it online from either [K&L](http://www.klwines.com/p/i?s=14EC5804A551&i=1207290) or [Astor Wines](http://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?p=2&search=33173&searchtype=Contains) for $29.99. I look forward to seeing what recipes people come up with using this pineapple rum in the coming year and plan to do some experimenting of my own as well. I noticed I recently ran out of reddit gold generously donated by my readers, so send some more this way if you want to support reddit and show your appreciation of this ongoing feature. Please leave any feedback and questions in the comments below and until next time, cheers!
