**Not Cocktail of the Week #8: Sidecar**  
For this week I thought I would return to a real simple and delicious classic, the Sidecar. It’s a great cocktail to be familiar with as it serves as a good template for discovering new cocktails which I will go into a little more detail below.  

**Background**  
As with many simple classic cocktails, the origins of the Sidecar cocktail are somewhat unclear, but one common thread is that this cocktail was invented after the end of World War I, first appearing in either Harry MacElhone’s *Harry’s ABC of Mixing Cocktails* (first published in 1919? 1921?) and/or Robert Vermeire’s *Cocktails and How to Mix Them* (published in 1922). Both of these sources initially credit this drink to Pat MacGarry, the bartender at Buck’s Club in London, but the original Sidecar cocktail was not popularized until it made the hop across the pond to Paris, perhaps due to their nationalistic pride for cognac or instead due to the story of an American Army captain in Paris who was driven around in a motorcycle sidecar. In France, the Ritz Hotel Paris claims to be the origins of this drink, perhaps resulting in the original Sidecar recipe to become known as the “French style”, comprised of equal parts cognac, Cointreau and lemon juice.  
Some years later, the modern Sidecar cocktail we know it was documented in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* from the Savoy Hotel in London in 1930. This Sidecar is referred to as the “English style” and is comprised of 2 parts cognac, 1 part Cointreau and 1 part lemon juice. In summary, it seems that the original Sidecar cocktail originated in London before becoming popular in Paris and known as the “French style”, but the “English style” variation is ultimately the cocktail that has endured until today, so in my book scoring the origins of the Sidecar, England: 2, France: 0.   

**Recipes**  
The recipe for the Sidecar hasn’t really changed over the last century, which just goes to show how well-balanced and satisfying this simple cocktail is.  
*Savoy Cocktail Book* circa 1930  
* 1/4 Lemon Juice  
* 1/4 Cointreau  
* 1/2 Brandy  
Shake well and strain into cocktail glass  

*PDT Cocktail Book* circa 2011  
* 2 oz Remy Martin VSOP Cognac  
* 0.75 oz Cointreau  
* 0.75 oz Lemon Juice  
* 0.25 Simple Syrup  
Shake well with ice and strain into a chilled, half-sugar rimmed coupe  
This version is more modern as it is slightly more spirit-forward having dropped the amount of sour and orange liqueur a bit. As seen in the album accompanying this post.  

Bonus *French Style*  
* 1 part cognac  
* 1 part Cointreau  
* 1 part lemon juice  
Shaken on ice

**Results**  
This is both a classic and classy sour. With the sugar rim you first get an immediate sweetness on your tongue which combines with the acidity of lemon when the cocktail first hits your tongue. Cognac serves as a fruity backbone to this drink, which is enhanced by the sweetness of Cointreau. After you swallow, the remaining orphaned sugar crystals on your lips give a fleeting sweetness that invites another sip and repeating the cycle until your glass is drained.  

**Variations**  
The Sidecar is a great cocktail and easy cocktail recipe to keep in your head as its recipe of 2 strong, 1 sour, 1 sweet is a basic cocktail ratio that apparently only a “genius mixologist” can tell us about as seen in [this recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/190xex/from_a_genius_mixologist_the_only_ratio_you_need/) on /r/cocktails. Regardless, the since the Sidecar is a great basic recipe, it serves as a great template for variation. As pointed out by the well-known bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler, these ratios can be transformed into entirely new cocktails simply by substituting the base liquor/sour/sweet components. In [this article on his blog](http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2007/the-barate-kid/), he demonstrates how the Sidecar recipe can easily be used to make a Margarita by substituting top-shelf tequila for cognac and lime for lemon. Many cocktails are based on this 2:1:1 spirit:sour:sweet ratio, though I wouldn’t necessarily credit them all as variations on the Sidecar.  
The first Sidecar I ever made actually was a variation on the classic recipe that used bourbon, as when I was first getting into cocktails I made a lot of bourbon Manhattans and hadn’t acquired any cognac. I was inspired by [this post](http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/cocktail-recipe-bourbon-sidecar-for-two/) from the New York Times that substituted bourbon for cognac and a Meyer lemon instead of a normal lemon to provide additional sweetness. The substitution of gin as a base spirit for this drink results in another classic cocktail known as the White Lady. Substituting applejack for cognac is another simple variation that gives a nice autumnal feel to this cocktail. There are countless variations on this recipe that may or may not pay homage to the Sidecar, feel free to share your successful variations in the comments below.  

**Glass Rimming**  
A rimmed glass is a very nice touch for the Sidecar cocktail and I think adds to the overall experience both visually and flavorfully. I used to have some difficulty rimming a glass well so I figured this would be a good place to briefly share how I rim my glasses now.  
1. Chill your glass (seriously this is an essential step that I underappreciated and contributed to uneven rimming in my past).  
2. Pour a couple teaspoons of sugar (superfine/confectioner’s is better and can be made by putting your granulated sugar in a blender) or salt onto a small dish.  
3. Cut a fresh lemon (or lime for a Margarita for example). Halves are a bit easier to control, but a wedge could also work.  
4. Get your chilled cocktail glass.  
5. Squeeze out a very small amount of lemon/lime juice and keep it on the half/wedge.  
6. Rub the outside rim of the chilled cocktail glass with the wet lemon/lime.  
7. Carefully tap the outside rim of the cocktail glass to the sugar/salt and proceed around the entirety of the glass.  
8. Shake off any excess sugar/salt by gently tapping. If needed, this glass can be stored in a refrigerator for later use.  
9. Carefully strain your cocktail into your beautifully rimmed glass and enjoy.  
Firstly, my biggest mistake in the past was not using a chilled cocktail glass. The condensation that naturally occurs on a chilled glass gives a much more even coating of your glass. Secondly, don’t overdo the lemon/lime juice, you only need it to be slightly wet, if you have enough that it is forming drops on the glass, it will result in a lumpy looking rim. Finally, make sure to only rim the outside of the glass, the cocktail inside the glass should be unadulterated before drinking.  

**Cheers!**  
Hope you get a chance to enjoy a Sidecar this week or some variation of one. Post your favorite variation on a Sidecar below if you have any, or let me know your thoughts on this week’s column.
