**Not Cocktail of the Week #106: Cocktail a la Louisiane**  
While I currently reside in San Francisco with its permanently temperate clime, I am only reminded that it is winter when I hear stories of the horrible winter weather recently besieging New York or the in other parts of the country, all of which drive my seasonal desire for boozy brown stirred drinks. For this edition of NCotW, I want to share the Cocktail a la Louisiane, a close relative of the [Vieux Carre](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1a8cs5/not_cocktail_of_the_week_10_vieux_carr%C3%A9/) and a distant cousin of the [Sazerac](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1zk37d/not_cocktail_of_the_week_61_special_mardi_gras/).  

**Background**  
The Cocktail a la Louisiane aka La Louisiane, unsurprisingly hails from Louisiana, more specifically the La Louisiane Hotel and Restaurant in New Orleans (which recently was reincarnated as an event venue). The Cocktail a la Louisiane was the special cocktail at the Restaurant de la Louisiane and was first published in 1937 in Stanley Clisby Arthur’s *Famous New Orleans Drinks and How to Mix ‘Em*. In his words:   

>"This is the special cocktail served at Restaurant de la Louisiane, one of the famous French restaurants of New Orleans, long the rendezvous of those who appreciate the best in Creole cuisine. [The] La Louisiane cocktail is as out-of-the-ordinary as the many distinctive dishes that grace its menu."  

As previously noted, the Cocktail a la Louisiane is a close relative to the Vieux Carre, with a few dashes of absinthe in place of the Cognac, but somehow much less popular. One might hypothesize that perhaps it is due to a lack of appreciation for absinthe, but that clearly could not be the case given the impressive popularity and timelessness of the Sazerac. Perhaps it is due to the closing of the original La Louisiane Hotel and Restaurant, but again both the Sazerac and Vieux Carre survived multiple moves or venue closings of their own. Who knows what the indeterminate factor is that decides the popularity of a particular cocktail, but the Cocktail a la Louisiane is one that hasn’t yet been given its due.

**Results**  
As usual with classic cocktails, I tried as many versions of it as I could to gain an appreciation for the cocktail, both in its original form and how it might be encountered today. I started with the classic recipe calling for ¾ oz rye, sweet vermouth and Benedictine with 3 dashes each of Peychaud’s bitters and absinthe. This was a surprisingly short drink in the glass, which some speculate may be the intent as it is something to enjoy quickly while cold as a brief apertif. The nose of this version was a balance between the anise notes of absinthe accompanied by the unique dusty character I attribute to Peychaud’s and a fair amount of fruity cherry. Texturally, this was a rather thick drink that I found dominated by notes of absinthe, possibly due to my relative inexperience with appreciating its flavors. I also got some fruit, herb and honey notes, but was surprised at how easily the 100-proof spicy Rittenhouse rye got lost in this version. While I personally did not find this my favorite incarnation of the Cocktail a la Louisiane, this one might be well-suited for someone who really appreciates absinthe.  
I then tried a more modern recipe from *The PDT Cocktail Book*, which ups the portion of rye to 2 oz, bringing it more in line with modern stirred drinks. I found this version much more appealing to my palate with a nicely balanced nose of fruit, anise and spice. In the mouth I got the light dusty character of Peychaud’s up front, followed by spicy rye and the sweet herbal honey notes of Benedictine in the body, and finishing cleanly with sweet fruit and anise notes.   
I also found a modern version of the Cocktail a la Louisiane in Dave Arnold’s *Liquid Intelligence* which adds Angostura bitters and lowers the portion of sweet vermouth and Benedictine a little further. Compared to the PDT version, the nose of this version leaned more towards the spice notes of rye with fruit and anise in a supporting role. Upon sipping, I first noted a brief absinthe note quickly replaced by the sweet and herbal Benedictine. The body was the assertively spicy Rittenhouse rye that I expected which transitioned to a finish that started with the anise of absinthe before seamlessly transitioning to the unique Peychaud’s flavor. This version was surprisingly complex with more waves and transitions of flavor than I expected. I was surprised that I couldn’t easily place the Angostura in this version, but whether due to its presence or the cocktail itself being more spirit-forward, this evoked memories of my typical Manhattan. 

**Cheers!**  
Hope you’ve enjoyed this edition of NCotW and hopefully you’ll have a chance to enjoy a Cocktail a la Louisiane in the near future. If you’re a fan of the Vieux Carre, Sazerac, or Manhattan, this is a cocktail that should be up your alley as it was mine when I first had it a couple years ago. Thanks all for the continued support, particularly to /u/extramice this week who was generous enough to not only send me a bottle of Amaro Nonino, but to offer writing a guest post on one of his favorite drinks using it next month. Anyways, please leave your thoughts on the Cocktail a la Louisiane in the comments below, part of what makes /r/cocktails such a cool place for me are the discussions and feedback. Until next time, cheers!
