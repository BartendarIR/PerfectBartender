###Not Cocktail of the Week #67: 20th Century###

hebug was generous to give me this week to get up on my soapbox and lecture you all about my personal favorite cocktail, the 20th Century. As Ted Haigh writes in *Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails*, "I believe we now have a firm idea of exactly what Art Deco tastes like."

##Background##

The first publishing of the 20th Century appears in the *Café Royale Bar Book* in 1937, which served as a sort of bartenders' Bible in the UK during the inter-war period. The cocktail is named after the [20th Century Limited](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Limited), a train that ran from New York to Chicago. The line had been running as early as 1902 and primarily served upper-class business travelers. It had a reputation for being fast, sleek, and stylish; a sort of pre-jet-age first class travel. And although the [NYC Hudson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NYC_Hudson) wasn't actually put into service on the line until a year *after* the recipe was published, it became the iconic image of the 20th Century Limited, with illustrations of it used in both *Vintage Spirits* and *The PDT Cocktail Book* along side the 20th Century recipe.

Although the 20th Century can be called a *bona fide* classic cocktail, you'll rarely see it on a menu, or hear much about it. Why? Because it calls for crème de cacao (CdC). And if you've tried using it, you'll mostly likely notice: CdC **sucks**. And that brings me to a diversion I'd like to get out of the way before we delve into this wonderful drink.

##A Crash Course in Crème de Cacao##

If you've ever tried to buy or taste CdC, you've probably noticed that the stuff is virtually synonymous with sugary, weak, ridiculous college bar shot glass concoctions. It is, in many ways, antithetical to the classy rail line the 20th Century takes its name from. Most liquor stores only stock perrenially bottom-shelf-dwelling swill like Bols and Dekuyper. The one thing most modern, commercial CdCs have in common is that they taste like someone infused a Tootsie Roll into a 50/50 mix of vodka and sugar. 

Believe it or not, that flavor profile *will* work well in this drink. By sticking to the classic recipe (which only calls for half an ounce of the stuff), well, I'll again refer to Ted Haigh: "It goes down like a light, zingy lemonade, but in the aftertaste there is an ethereal *sense* of chocolate." But there is a better option - especially if you plan on experiencing some of the variants: [Tempus Fugit's crème de cacao](http://www.tempusfugitspirits.com/liqueurs-cremes).

Tempus Fugit's CdC puts on the big boy pants with a heavy dose of *actual* cocoa flavor, dialing back the sweetness, and including prominent vanilla and herbal qualities, with an earthy, roasty finish on the back end. All this is offered with a dark caramel color and syrupy body; comparable to a gomme syrup. I simply cannot recommend it enough.

The downside (and of course there was one) is that Tempus Fugit doesn't have the best distribution in the United States, and can be very hard to come by. Some online liquor stores have it - K&L Wines and DrunkupNY to name a few. But here in Seattle, there is virtually no retail availability. So you may have to make your own infusion. Or slum it with the widely-available stuff. I'm using Tempus Fugit for the results section below.

##Recipes##

Before I give the recipes, I want to make one more note about ingredients. The original recipe for this drink called for Lillet. Originating from the 1930s, what the cocktail would have actually been using was *Kina Lillet* - the same thing called for in James Bond's Vesper. While Lillet is still produced commercially, it underwent a reformulation in 1986 and came out as Lillet Blanc - the stuff you can still buy today. It's important to note that in the reformulation, much of a quinine and herbal flavors were dialed back, and the sweetness increased. It is generally accepted that today, **the closest you can get to classic Kina Lillet is Cocchi Americano, so I recommend making that substitution in these recipes.**

#*Café Royale Bar Book*, 1937 via *Vintage Spirits And Forgotten Cocktails*, Ted Haigh, 2009#
* 1.5 oz. gin
* 3/4 oz. Lillet Blanc (see note above)
* 3/4 oz. fresh lemon juice
* 1/2 oz. light crème de cacao
* Shake, strain into chilled coupe, lemon twist.

#*The PDT Cocktail Book*, Jim Meehan, 2011#
* 1.5 oz. Plymouth gin
* 3/4 oz. Mari Brizard White Crème de Cacao
* 3/4 oz. Lillet Blanc (see note above)
* 3/4 oz. fresh lemon juice
* Shake, strain into chilled coupe.

##Variations##

The 20th Century is a surprisingly versatile cocktail, and many varations can be made to the base spirit. Mezcal and Scotch work particularly well. High West Campfire is especially wonderful.

#*The 21st Century*, Jim Meehan#
* 2 oz. Siete Leguas Blanco tequila
* 3/4 oz. Marie Brizard crème de cacao
* 3/4 oz. lemon juice
* Pernod, to rinse coupe
* Shake ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled, Pernod-rinsed coupe.

#*The Best 20th Century Variant*#
* 1.5 oz. Ardbeg (or any Islay Scotch - Black Bottle and other blends are okay, but trust me, the single malt's worth it)
* 3/4 oz. lemon juice
* 3/4 oz. Cocchi Americano
* 1/2 oz. Tempus Fugit Crème de Cacao a la Vanille
* Stir, pour into a chilled cocktail glass. No garnish.

##Results##

The classic 20th Century has a nutty, earthy, citrusy nose. Sipping gives the initial impression of a sweet, citrusy cloud that quickly gives way to the astringency and roasted coffee notes on the mid-palate, with a lingering, bitter chocolate finish.

The Ardbeg variant's nose is dominated by the smokiness of the Scotch. It hits the tongue with none of the classic's subtlety, lingering for a moment before giving way to a sour tingle and a bold, dark, smoked chocolate. Coating the tongue, it finishes with the peat of the scotch coalescing with the tartness of the lemon and subdued, earthy notes of the cocoa.
