**Not Cocktail of the Week #77: Hoop La!**  
Part of what I love about doing NCotW is that it forces me to constantly seek new delicious cocktails to have something worth sharing. This process keeps me learning, keeps me excited, and keeps pushing me out of my comfort zone. That moment of joy when I put a new cocktail to my lips and really experience how it’s more than the sum of its parts is sublime. This is one of those cocktails that looked pretty interesting on paper and relatively average in its composition, but turned out to be right up my alley. So for this week’s NCotW, I will share the little that is known about a cocktail that appears in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* no less than three times, the Hoop La! 

**Background**  
As a rather obscure cocktail that hasn’t enjoyed much popularity, there is not much known about the background of the Hoop La! or any of its identical triplet (quadruplet?) brothers, the Frank Sullivan and the Odd McIntyre (and the Hey Hey). As far as I am able to ascertain, they first appear in Harry Craddock’s *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, along with the very similar and much more well-known [Corpse Reviver No. 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/17555c/not_cocktail_of_the_week_3_corpse_reviver_2/). While I am unable to find any mention of this, some believe that Mr. Craddock invented the gin-based Corpse Reviver No. 2 and if so, it is possible that he also invented the very similar brandy-based Hoop La! and its kin. The name Hoop La! likely refers to the somewhat archaic slang for an exciting public commotion. Erik Ellestad hypothesizes that the Frank Sullivan is named after the American journalist for the New Yorker magazine. Frank Sullivan was a member of the Algonquin Round Table, a group of very influential writers and actors that gathered in the 1920s, akin to the [Clover Club](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1go8m1/not_cocktail_of_the_week_24_clover_club/), which was similarly immortalized in the realm of cocktails by the Algonquin cocktail. In terms of the origins of the Odd McIntyre, Erik Ellestad believes it is named after Oscar “Odd” McIntyre, another famed New York journalist who was one of the founding members of the whimsical IBF (International Bar Flies) organization along with Harry McElhone (famed for authoring *Barflies and Cocktails* and inventing the [Boulevardier](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/180rvd/not_cocktail_of_the_week_5_boulevardier/)). However, as for why these three identical drinks are included in the same book under different guises is still a mystery, but maybe Mr. Craddock just really wanted this particular creation to take off.

**Results**  
While the Hoop La! cocktail bears a striking resemblance to the [Corpse Reviver No. 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/17555c/not_cocktail_of_the_week_3_corpse_reviver_2/) substituting brandy for gin and losing the absinthe rinse, I actually find this much flavor profile much closer to a lightened up [Sidecar](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/19cmfw/not_cocktail_of_the_week_8_sidecar/). I get a rich fruit and citrus notes on the nose, with a sweet hint of honey notes from the brandy. On the palate, I find that the Hoop La! is light and lively, lacking the thick mouthfeel that I often find in  relatively sweet cocktails. The first flavor I experience is a light delicate citrus sweetness from the Cointreau that sparkles as it intertwines playfully with the zingy lemon. The Lillet comes through in the midnotes, adding complexity with its botanical and bitter orange notes, which transitions to a juicy lemon finish complemented by the fruity brandy. I think this is a light and approachable unique take on the flavor profile of a Sidecar, though with the additional sweetness from the Lillet, I personally wouldn’t serve this with a sugared rim. I have a particular appreciation of cocktails that use equal parts for some reason, maybe because they’re easier to remember, but also because I feel like they are so much more amenable to variation (for example the Last Word’s countless modern variants), so I went ahead and played around with a couple variations myself. 

**Variations**  
I started first by changing the base spirit from brandy to bourbon (Bulleit), having had previous success with a Bourbon Sidecar some four years ago from this [NYTimes article]( http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/cocktail-recipe-bourbon-sidecar-for-two/). This variation still retained a nice sour and fruity nose, though I was unable to detect any bourbon on the nose. While still starting with the familiar light sweetness and balanced tartness, this variation was not as luscious as the original, I believe because bourbon lacks the strong fruity notes of brandy that complement these flavors so well. This resulted in a feeling of thinness in the middle that ended up stumbling awkwardly to the finish line as the oaky vanilla notes of bourbon tried to assert. I think that bourbon and Lillet simply do not play well together, lacking much complementarity, but if anyone has a different opinion or experience, I’d love to hear it.  
I had a bit more success replacing the base spirit with apple brandy (Laird’s bonded), which carries its own very robust fruity notes. The nose was full of sweet orange and light apple notes that are the first flavor notes I get upon sipping. The Lillet again comes in the midnotes adding some complexity from the bitter orange, then finishes with the apple brandy and a bit of heat due to the higher proof of the apple brandy. I also got an unexpected odd earthy bitterness on the finish that detracted a bit, possibly needing some rebalancing to accommodate for the higher proof of bonded apple brandy, but I imagine this variation done with standard applejack would probably be pleasantly smooth and balanced.  
I finally felt like I achieved some actual success in switching out the Cointreau in the original recipe for some apricot brandy (Rothman & Winter). Lacking the sweet orange of Cointreau in the nose, this version feels a bit richer with the depth afforded by notes of stone fruit. These notes complement brandy very well, amplifying the fruitiness a lot while still playing very well with the tartness from lemon. Again I was struck by how well the apricot brandy goes with brandy, resulting in a rich fruit note that runs throughout the entire cocktail. A bit of bitter orange comes through near the end, but it has a surprisingly crisp finish with just some apricot continuing to persist on the palate. Using the slightly thicker apricot brandy in place of Cointreau also gives a more silky texture that I really enjoyed. I was quite pleased with this variation, so if you have the means, give it a shot yourself and share how you found it. 

**Cheers!**  
A special thanks to Rachel here at the end for her generous gift of David Wondrich’s book *Punch*! It is a very well-timed early birthday gift and I am already using it to make a punch for a friend’s party this weekend (Plymouth Pilgrim’s Punch). There are no shortage of great cocktail books I’d love to own, so if you want to share your appreciation, expand my repertoire of potential cocktails, and ultimately further my ability to write these posts, find my Amazon cocktail book wishlist [here](http://amzn.com/w/LJIN08K4RTJW). As a side note, I’ve just purchased *Beach Bum Berry Remixed* to prepare for an exciting onslaught of Tiki cocktails for NCotW this summer. Also, thanks to the anonymous donor for another month of reddit gold following last week’s post on the Gimlet. These gifts of appreciation are well-received and I am thankful for all the notes of support, especially last week’s success story from /u/ILoveaMILF ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/28ldea/just_a_quick_thank_you_to_rcocktails_and_uhebug/)).  
Anyways, hope you’ve enjoyed this week’s post, it was a pleasant surprise for me and hopefully it will be for you as well. I’d love to hear if you try this cocktail and also any interesting variations you might have or be able to suggest. Next week’s post will most likely be a cocktail hinted at in this week’s post, but until then, cheers!
