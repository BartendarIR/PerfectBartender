**Not Cocktail of the Week #37: Japanese**  
Hello faithful readers of NCotW! For this week’s column, I wanted to share a simple cocktail that, despite being one of the earliest recorded cocktails, I only recently discovered and haven’t seen on offer in any bars or much of at all. I find the Japanese cocktail to be a delicious after-dinner libation well-suited for all of the baked goods that accompany the holiday season as well as just for autumn and winter in general. 

**Background**  
The Japanese cocktail is first found in Jerry Thomas’ revolutionary work, *The Bar-Tender’s Guide*, originally published in 1862. In fact, the Japanese cocktail is one of just thirteen official cocktails included in this work and additionally is likely to be the only one created by Jerry Thomas himself. As if that were not enough to make the Japanese cocktail noteworthy, it also the first “commemorative” cocktail, as it was created for an occasion and its composition has nothing Japanese about it. David Wondrich traces its creation to June of 1860, when a Japanese legation (a diplomatic minister and their staff) comprised literally of Samurai, was visiting the United States, staying at the Metropolitan hotel in New York. The legman (assistant who gathers information and runs errands) of the legation, a certain Tateishi Onojirou Noriyuki aka Tommy, happened to be interested in the American custom of drinking cocktails. It is very likely then that he and his friends wandered across the street to Jerry Thomas’ “palace” bar at 622 Broadway. Jerry Thomas probably created this cocktail to their liking and this chance encounter was immortalized in his book as one of the original cocktails. Unfortunately, for some reason or another, the Japanese cocktail was not popularized or seemed to catch on. A “short” 20 years later, *The Minneapolis Tribune* in 1886 described it as thus:  
>“The Japanese cocktail is [a] liquid attack of spinal meningitis. It is loaded with knock-kneed mental ceramics, and is apt to make a man throw stones at his grandfather.”  

Regardless, after discovering this cocktail and finding myself enjoying this cocktail quite thoroughly, I thought it was worthy of sharing with the rest of you. The original cocktail calls for Bogart’s bitters, which no longer exist, but David Wondrich suggests Boker’s or Fee’s Aromatic Bitters, finding that Angostura or Peychaud’s is too strong. I didn’t have any problem with Angostura, but if you happen to be in possession of either of his suggestions, feel free to throw those in instead. Additionally, this cocktail was originally enjoyed on the rocks, though I agree with David Wondrich in that it is better strained, but I can definitely see the appeal of it either way.

**Results**  
As you can see in the photos, I had a ridiculously good lemon as the peel gave me a ton of lemon oil on top, contributing to a very lush lemon aroma in the nose, backed by the fruity sweetness of cognac. In the mouth, I first get the sweet nuttiness of orgeat, which transitions to the fruit and warmth of cognac, and ending with a cream and spice finish. Since a significant portion of the Japanese cocktail is orgeat, it is pleasantly full-textured and goes down very smoothly. The appearance of this cocktail is very reminiscent of milk tea for me and I think this striking resemblance crossed some wires in my taste memory and expectations, as I seemed to detect a tannic note, which I suppose could be from the heavy dashes of Angostura bitters. In any case, I can see myself serving this cocktail after dinner with dessert, in fact I happened had a great dessert to complement this cocktail, which I share more of below. 

**Marcus Samuelsson’s Coconut Cookies from Aquavit**  
While having the Japanese cocktail, I serendipitously had some coconut cookies that my wife had recently made. Thinking for a couple seconds, I realized that they would be a perfect accompaniment to this after-dinner cocktail with their sweet and nutty flavor. She is quite the accomplished home chef and has previously blogged about her efforts [here](http://nookandpantry.blogspot.com/), but with life becoming more busy, her [new blog](http://www.goldenweekendblog.com/) is a much more relaxed and creative affair (please don’t stalk us). In any case, she made these cookies from a recipe by Marcus Samuelsson, an Ethiopian-born, Swedish-raised chef, owner of multiple restaurants, and winner of season 2 of Top Chef Masters (we were huge Top Chef nerds…and may still be). Anyways, this cookie is really great and if you make it, I would recommend using Bob’s Red Mill Flaked Unsweetened Coconut, which can be found on Amazon, mostly because my wife did a lot of research into different coconut products at some point and concluded this was the best. Anyways, on to the recipe!

* 2 tbsp unsalted butter  
* 2.5 cups unsweetened shredded coconut  
* 2 large eggs  
* 0.25 cup sugar  

1.	Preheat the oven to 350F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.  
2.	Melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat and add the shredded coconut, mixing well with a rubber spatula.  
3.	In a large bowl, beat the eggs with an electric mixer on medium speed just to blend. Beat in the sugar, then increase the speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy. Stir in the coconut until thoroughly mixed.  
4.	Drop rounded teaspoons of the batter onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1.5 inches apart. Bake for 8-10 minutes, until the tips of the cookies are pale gold. Slide the parchment paper, with the cookies on it, onto wire cooling racks and let cool completely.  

**Cheers!**  
Hopefully I’ve done the Japanese cocktail justice, as I feel it has lain dormant for some time despite its impressive origins and it being quite enjoyable. I also highly recommend those cookies as a pairing if you have the means and opportunity, though they are also quite delicious on their own. Your feedback and questions are welcome in the comments section and if you are interested in contributing a favorite cocktail of your own to NCotW, feel free to send me a PM. Otherwise, until next week dear readers, cheers!
