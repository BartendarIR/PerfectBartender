**Not Cocktail of the Week #22: Claridge**  
Welcome back to your regular weekly NCotW feature. For this week’s post, I wanted to introduce the Claridge cocktail, a classic cocktail I first attempted after coming across a bottle of DeKuyper Apricot (flavored) Brandy in my parents’ bar and combing through my recently acquired copy of *Joy of Mixology* for cocktails utilizing apricot brandy. Despite the artificially flavored apricot brandy, the Claridge cocktail came out quite tasty and was memorable enough for me to revisit over a year later with better ingredients, and subsequently share with all of you for sipping on in warm summer weather.

**Background**  
The origins of the Claridge cocktail are surprisingly well-documented thanks to Gary ‘gaz’ Regan’s regular Cocktailian column in the San Francisco Chronicle, whose original article on the Claridge can be found in the links section below. Starting from the recipe in the *Savoy Cocktail Book*, which is the most likely place you will come across the Claridge cocktail, Mr. Regan infers that the cocktail likely came with Ada Coleman, who worked at the Savoy Hotel from 1903 to 1925 and originally hailed from the Claridge Hotel in London, where this drink gets its name. A little more digging by Mr. Regan into *Barflies and Cocktails* by Harry McElhone (see also: [Boulevardier](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/180rvd/not_cocktail_of_the_week_5_boulevardier/)) documents the origins of the Claridge cocktail to “Leon”, a bartender at Claridge’s Hotel in Paris. Whether these two hotels in Paris and London are related is unclear, I would assume so, and that the Claridge cocktail served as a signature drink at these classic institutions.  

**Recipes**  
*The Savoy Cocktail Book*, circa 1930  
* 1/3 dry gin  
* 1/3 French vermouth  
* 1/6 apricot brandy  
* 1/6 Cointreau  
Shaken on ice, strained  

*The Joy of Mixology*, 2003  
* 1 oz gin  
* 1 oz dry vermouth  
* 0.5 oz triple sec  
* 0.5 oz apricot brandy  
Stirred on ice, strained

**Results**  
The Claridge cocktail always reminds me of a fruity, but still classy, variation on the classic Martini. I elected to use Tanqueray Malacca for this version, since I thought the mild and orangey characteristics would easily complement the fruity additions from Cointreau and apricot brandy. As expected, the Claridge is relatively light, with a mild floral nose. The flavors of the Claridge progress from being initially sweet, transitioning to the citrus characteristics of Malacca enhanced by Cointreau, to a brief reminder of gin through juniper notes, and finally finishing with the fruity apricot. I also noted a slight spice characteristic, which must be from the Malacca. Due to the substantial contributions of both Cointreau and apricot brandy, it has a very smooth and well-rounded texture. Ultimately, the Claridge is a sweet fruity drink and would definitely appeal to those unaccustomed to some of the more bitter, complex, and spirit-forward cocktails that /r/cocktails seems to prefer. Still, it is important to remember that as a bartender, or when just entertaining at home, that it is not our place to judge what someone desires in a drink, so having a cocktail like this available can allow all our guests to enjoy themselves.  

**Variations**  
I think in terms of variations, the Claridge could be easily changed by the use of other fruit brandies. Clear Creek Distillery makes some pretty nice brandies, their pear brandy would likely make a delicious substitution for apricot brandy in this cocktail. I’ve never had a plum brandy, but perhaps that could work as well. If anyone wants to do some experimenting with these substitutions that I do not have the materials for, I’d love to hear if it works in the comments.

**Apricot Brandy**  
Apricot Brandy is a surprisingly popular ingredient in cocktails from the *Savoy Cocktail Book*, as well as other classic cocktail compendiums. Unfortunately, much like amaretto, apricot brandy has an image problem, associated with underage drinking and terribly sweet “cocktails”. It doesn’t help that the majority of “apricot brandy” that exists on the market is artificially colored, flavored, and overly sweetened. True apricot brandy, distilled from the fermentation of apricots, is extremely difficult to find, but luckily there are a few acceptable alternatives for true apricot brandy, which technically would be considered apricot liqueurs since they are sweetened. Regardless, most cocktail recipes, when referring to apricot brandy, are actually calling for these apricot liqueurs, so do not fret over not being able to find true apricot brandy. If you are interested in getting some apricot liqueur, there are a couple solid recommendations that are pretty widely agreed upon to be a quality product and worth tracking down. My preference, after some research, is Rothman and Winter’s Orchard Apricot, as its base is an apricot eau-de-vie, and it is characterized as having a very fresh aroma and flavor of apricot without significant sugar. Rothman and Winter also offer a very solid crème de violette, if you are into making the classic Aviation cocktail. The other good apricot liqueur is offered by Marie Brizard, a French beverage company known for its quality fruit liqueurs. This [article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/11/AR2011011103433.html) from the Washington Post has a little more information on true apricot brandies if you are interested in pursuing them, and this [article](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/01/apricot-brandy-cocktails-drinks.html) from SeriousDrinks has a few more suggestions for delicious cocktails to use apricot brandy in.

**Cheers!**  
Hopefully the Claridge cocktail will be one that you will remember for guests seeking a cocktail with more fruit characteristics or one that you will enjoy when you want something light and sweet. As usual, questions, comments, suggestions are all welcome, and if you are interested in contributing a guest post, drop me a line. A final brief note, if you wish to extend a special gesture of appreciation, rather than reddit gold (which I already have for the foreseeable future thanks to a few individuals), my cocktail book wishlist can be found [here](http://amzn.com/w/LJIN08K4RTJW), or if you wish to contribute some new bartools from Cocktail Kingdom, just ask since I can’t share that wishlist easily. Until next week, cheers!
