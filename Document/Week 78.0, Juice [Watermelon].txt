**Not Cocktail of the Week #78: Melon Stand**  
So while last week I hinted that I would be tackling the classic Algonquin this week, I had some difficulty making it palatable, an opinion I found I shared with /u/ABarAbove, who I met up with very recently. Luckily, I already had plans to do the Melon Stand, a great modern cocktail, which honestly seems better timed for this week as it is an amazing summertime drink and would very well suited for any Independence Day BBQ you may have this weekend. 

**Background**  
As a modern drink having only been around a handful of years, there is not much background to go over, for which I am at times thankful for. The Melon Stand is published in *The PDT Cocktail Book* and credited to Jane Danger in the summer of 2008. It is named after her Minnesota dream bar, Jane’s Sweet Melon Stand, though I personally don’t really get that as a name. 

**Recipes**  
*The PDT Cocktail Book*, Jim Meehan, 2011  
* 2 oz Plymouth Gin  
* 1 oz Watermelon Juice  
* 0.75 oz Lemon Juice  
* 0.5 oz Aperol  
* 0.5 oz Simple Syrup  
Shake with ice and strain into a chilled Collins glass filled with pebble ice. Garnish with three watermelon balls on a pick.  

**Results**  
Before I came across the Melon Stand, I had been considering putting together fresh watermelon juice with gin, Aperol and lemon somehow, so coming across this recipe was a pleasant moment of serendipity. The Melon Stand smells delightful, with its notes of sweet watermelon and light herbaceous gin combining to smell very summery. From the portion of watermelon juice and Aperol, the Melon Stand has a satisfying and smooth texture. It tastes as summery as it smells, refreshing and sweet with a light playful tartness. It starts with the refreshing sweet notes of watermelon and fruity Aperol contrasting with tangy lemon. In the middle the citrusy and lightly herbaceous Plymouth gin comes forward, serving as the body of the drink before transitioning seamlessly to the mild citrus bitterness of Aperol and finishing with a brief juniper note and lemon oil aromatics. The obligatory fresh watermelon as garnish is better than expected as it remains sweeter than the cocktail itself and thus provides a pleasant burst of sweetness. Additionally, its crispness adds a nice textural element to the drink, so having multiple bits whether in balls or small cubes, is lovely. This cocktail is exceptionally easy drinking, smooth, fruity, and refreshing, so a pitcher of it would be lovely, but potentially dangerous, for a group gathering. As a final note, I do highly recommend using Plymouth gin for its citrus and mild juniper notes for the Melon Stand, as it works particularly well here.

**Variations**  
Riffing off the thought of serving this at a BBQ, I wonder how this would taste using grilled watermelon to make juice. Adding a smoky dimension might be divine.

**Cheers!**  
Thanks for reading this week’s NCotW, hope you’re still enjoying it as much as I am. If anyone has suggestions on how to better prepare or enjoy an Algonquin, I’m still hoping that I might be able to write about it. As always, your questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome below. Thanks for all the support I’ve received in the form of reddit gold or cocktail books off my [Amazon wishlist](http://amzn.com/w/LJIN08K4RTJW). I’ve got some great stuff planned for the next couple months, which include some sort of special post for my cakeday/birthday and Tiki drinks galore, so it should be a great summer for NCotW. Finally, hope you all have a safe and enjoyable Independence Day and have a chance to raise a toast with a Melon Stand. Until next week, cheers!
