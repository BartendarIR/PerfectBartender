**Not Cocktail of the Week #12: Pamplemousse**  
With the advent of spring, I thought I would write about the Pamplemousse cocktail for this week’s column, as its bright and peppy flavors are well-suited for the vibrancy of spring. 

**Background**  
As a modern cocktail, there is not a lot of background history to cover, but as it is near and dear to my heart for personal reasons, I figure I might as well share the story of how I came to love this cocktail.   
When I was living in Seattle, my wife (girlfriend then) and I discovered this terrific Cajun/Creole restaurant called [Toulouse Petit](http://toulousepetit.com/) in the Queen Anne neighborhood. We found ourselves visiting this place quite often, very specifically on weekday mornings because of their breakfast happy hour where almost everything on their extensive menu, including cocktails, was $7 (sidenote: if you live in Seattle and have never eaten there, you have to go). I came to love a particular cocktail of theirs, known as the Katie-Mae, which is comprised of vodka, St. Germain, grapefruit juice, and sparkling wine. I worked on recreating this drink and it resides in my old notebook still, but it was this drink that led to our discovery of the Pamplemousse.  
I first heard of the Pamplemousse through my friend’s cocktail-loving brother as I was waxing on about the Katie-Mae and St. Germain, which was all the rage and on every single cocktail menu a couple of years ago. He mentioned that his favorite cocktail with St. Germain was the Pamplemousse, though he couldn’t remember the exact recipe. Some internet searching turned up a number of different Pamplemousse cocktails, as the word pamplemousse is French for “grapefruit”, but I eventually found and confirmed the right recipe on [foodandwine.com](http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/pamplemousse-cocktails-2011). This cocktail is credited to Ryan Fitzgerald, a bartender at Beretta, an Italian restaurant located in the Mission neighborhood of San Francisco (note to self: visit this place now that I live in SF). 
In any case, the Pamplemousse rapidly became a regular cocktail, as one my significant other really enjoyed, which is pretty rare. It also ended up being her signature cocktail at our wedding and was a really big hit amongst our friends. The handmade bar menu at our wedding seen in the album now hangs in my home bar. Hopefully you’ll all enjoy it as much as we do.  

**Recipe**  
* 1 oz London dry gin (I used Plymouth for its mild character)  
* 1 oz grapefruit juice (guiltily I admit I often end up using presqueezed Simply Grapefruit recently)  
* 0.5 oz St. Germain elderflower liqueur  
* 0.5 oz lemon juice  
Shaken on ice and double/fine strained  
Garnish with a slapped basil leaf (take a clean basil leaf in the palm of your hand and clap once with your other)

**Results**  
This makes for a terrific daytime cocktail with its relatively low alcohol content and in the words of its creator Ryan Fitzgerald himself, “It's bright, refreshing and low in alcohol—a great pick-me-up.” This certainly is a great cocktail to have at brunch on weekends, but is also suitable throughout the day. SeriousDrinks describes it as “enhanced grapefruit juice”, which I consider a pretty apt description.  
You first sense this cocktail through the vegetal and herbal aroma of the slapped basil leaf garnish. When you start sipping this cocktail, it provides a soft contrast to the primary flavors of gin and grapefruit juice. I always find the combination of gin and grapefruit delicious, as that is how I enjoy a Greyhound (why vodka why), with the slight bitter note of grapefruit pairing with the juniper and herbal notes of gin. The St. Germain contributes a slight sweetness, but mostly serves to amplify the fruity notes of the grapefruit juice and gin, as most of its sweetness is directly counteracted by the added lemon juice. This cocktail is extremely smooth and easy to down, so if you’re having this at brunch, be cautious if you have plans to be productive the rest of the day.

**St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur**  
As I previously mentioned, elderflower liqueur was very popular a few years ago, finding its way onto cocktail menus all over the country. It is unclear exactly how this happened, but I found myself falling for its delicate fruit flavors which I find reminiscent of lychee, pear, and peach. It also didn’t hurt that the bottle is very beautifully designed, which added to its attractiveness to my significant other.  
As with many liqueurs, it has a well-designed story and history that adds to its appeal. St. Germain is made from wild elderflowers that are freshly handpicked for a season of six to eight weeks each year. These handpicked flowers are packed into sacks and loaded onto bikes before being transported down the hillside to the collection depot. How exactly they are able to collect enough for worldwide production by old men in bikes is beyond me, but I can neither dispute nor verify these claims it certainly makes a cute story. The collected elderflower blossoms are immediately macerated on a daily schedule to ensure the maximal amount of freshness to preserve the maximal amount of flavor and aroma of the delicate elderflower. The results of this maceration are blended with a grape *eau-de-vie* and then sweetened to produce St. Germain.  
St. Germain pairs very well with sparkling and white wines, with the classic St. Germain cocktail being comprised of 2 parts sparkling wine, 2 parts soda water and 1.5 parts St. Germain. I also find that you can do a pretty delicious white wine spritzer by adding St. Germain to a dry white wine and then topping with soda water. St. Germain can be an interesting substitution for simple syrup in most cocktails, adding a fruity note without being overly sweet. Although its popularity seems to be fading, I still find it to be a delicious and interesting liqueur to keep around in my home bar. 

**Cheers!**  
Hopefully you’ve enjoyed one of my personal favorite modern cocktails and if you have, I’d love to hear about it in the comments. I’d love to hear about your favorite St. Germain cocktails as well. I’ll be revisiting a basic but delicious classic cocktail next week that anyone should be able to make at home. If you have any other comments, suggestions, or questions, feel free to send me a message.
