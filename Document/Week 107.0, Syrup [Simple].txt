**Not Cocktail of the Week #107: Latin Quarter**  
After the well-timed guest post on the cleverly named [Between the Sheets](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1xqbox/not_cocktail_of_the_week_58_between_the_sheets/) from /u/GWCad for Valentine’s Day last year, I thought it would be fun to have a vaguely Valentine’s Day connection this week. To that end, I wanted to share a modern creation called the Latin Quarter which, while not romantically named, is a great use for the Bittermen’s Xocolatl Mole bitters I finally picked up and possibly an aphrodisiac.

**Background**  
The Latin Quarter was created at Death & Co. in New York by Joaquin Simo in 2008. He was part of the opening staff at that acclaimed establishment and was awarded “American Bartender of the Year” at Tales of the Cocktail in 2012. Shortly following that accolade, he opened Pouring Ribbons a few blocks away. In his own words, “We want to be accessible, we want to be fun; we don't want to be the cocktail bar with a million rules or the cocktail bar that keeps saying no to people. […] It's not just about the drink, it's more about the guest.”  
As for the Latin Quarter cocktail, it is said to be named after the New Orleans neighborhood and perhaps as loose homage to his Latin roots. Originally created to feature the Bittermen’s Xocolatl Mole bitters, as Death & Co. bartenders received their products before they even hit the market, the Latin Quarter has seen its popularity grow over the years and onto unexpected menus. Again in Joaquin’s words, “It’s hard to predict which D&C drinks will be replicated elsewhere. This Sazerac variation has ended up on the menus of cocktail bars all over the world.”

**Recipes**  
*Death & Co.*, David Kaplan, 2014  
* Vieux Pontarlier Absinthe  
* 2 oz Zacapa 23-year rum  
* 1 tsp cane sugar syrup [rich]

* 1 dash Angostura bitters  
* 1 dash Bittermen’s Xocolatl Mole bitters  
* 1 lemon twist  
Rinse a double rocks glass with absinthe and dump. Stir the remaining ingredients (except the lemon twist) over ice, then strain into the glass. Squeeze the lemon twist over the drink and discard. No garnish.

**Results**  
I actually first encountered this drink through a friend from Chicago, who credited this drink to The Violet Hour, a big player in the Chicago cocktail scene. While initially confused by this, it turns out that Alchemy Consulting, the consulting company Joaquin Simo works for and helped open Pouring Ribbons, lists The Violet Hour as one of their clients. Partnering your cocktail with a quality product and popularizing it through a consulting company is a strategy that has worked well for this creation.  
I first made one as closely to spec as I could, but substituting the apparently mediocre at best Absente for Vieux Pontarlier for the rinse. Also it should be noted that, according to the book, the cane sugar syrup that is called for in the recipe is actually a rich cane syrup with 2 parts ~~Demerara~~ cane sugar and 1 part water. I noticed this detail was glossed over in a number of recipes and could significantly alter the final drink. The drink started with a sweet and fruity nose from the lemon oil and rum, with a definite Peychaud’s note and a hint of earthiness from the Xocolatl Mole bitters. Texturally it was pretty typical, but made up for it with its complex flavor. It started with an earthy chocolate note combined with Peychaud’s “dusty” note, transitioned to the smooth, fruity and delicately sweet flavor of Ron Zacapa, concluding with a fabulous spice and bitter finish. I think the mole spices and Angostura spices play really well with each other on the end, with their flavors building with each swallow. As the drink sat a bit as I sipped it, I noted that the chocolate notes got more prominent over as it warmed slightly.  
After that initial success, I started to think about taking advantage of the rums I acquired for NCotW Tiki Editions last summer, particularly the Demerara rum El Dorado 12. I love the caramel-y smoky sugar notes in Demerara rum and thought it would play nicely with the spicy chocolate notes of the Latin Quarter. This version was pretty similar in its nose, perhaps a bit more lemon and a little less sugary. The flavor of this variation particularly appealed to me as I really love that unique Demerara flavor. It starts similarly with earthy chocolate and a subtle Peychaud’s note, but instead of the honey sweet fruitiness of aged Spanish-style rum, this one comes in with the sweet and smoky flavor of Demerara. This brings forward a much more dessert-like chocolate character out of the Xocolatl Mole bitters, shifting the finish away from spice. As this version warmed slightly, I got a bit more of the Demerara aroma in the nose. Finally, because of Demerara rum’s inherent or perceived sweetness, I would consider backing off on the simple syrup a hair the next time I make this. 

**Cheers!**  
Happy Valentine’s Day to everyone this week, I know a fair number of you have an extensive collection of bitters, so I hope you’ll be able to give this tasty use of chocolate bitters a try. If you like sipping aged rum or Sazeracs, I think you’ll like this one. Please let me know what you think in the comments section below. As usual, I love the regular discussion and perspectives that I get from all of you. I’ve should have a guest post lined up for the next installment of NCotW, so please look forward to that soon. On that note, if you want to share and/or educate yourself on a cocktail you love in this format, send me a message and we can make the necessary arrangements. Otherwise, until next time, cheers!
