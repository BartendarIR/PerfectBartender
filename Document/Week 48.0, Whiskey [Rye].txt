**Not Cocktail of the Week #49: Twelve Mile Limit**  
Tomorrow is the 80th anniversary of the Repeal of Prohibition with the ratification of the 21st Amendment on December 5, 1933. In honor of Repeal Day, I thought it would be appropriate to share a cocktail that exists as a direct consequence of Prohibition, the Twelve Mile Limit. While there are many classic Prohibition era cocktails, the Twelve Mile Limit is unique as it draws its name from a specific aspect of Prohibition. I first learned of the Twelve Mile Limit cocktail from [this](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/08/forgotten-classic-cocktails-you-should-know-drink-recipes.html) article from Serious Drinks titled “10 Lesser-Known Cocktails You Should Be Drinking”. As one of the few I had never tried, it has been on my to-do list for a fair amount of time. After recently having and enjoying it, the Twelve Mile Limit is a fantastic cocktail whose history is appropriate for celebrating Repeal Day, as well as being a classic cocktail whose similarities to the infamous modern Long Island Iced Tea will hopefully help ease you through the stresses of the holiday season.

**Background**  
When Prohibition was enacted in 1919, it made the production, transport, and selling of alcohol within the United States illegal. While this seems straightforward enough, as with many laws, particularly those governing vices, there were many loopholes and oddities surrounding the enforcement of this law. For example, while making beer with >0.5% ABV was illegal, you could legally make wine and cider of any ABV at home so long as you did not exceed 200 gallons(!) a year. A more well-known exception was that a doctor could prescribe whiskey for his patients, though I’m unsure what maladies that would cure other than a wicked hangover.  
Another of these creative loopholes that people took advantage of to get their fix was to technically leave the United States, whose jurisdiction legally ended 3 miles off shore in international waters (though many notable bartenders went much further than that, crossing the Atlantic altogether). This was relatively easy to achieve if you could travel to the shore and it led to the existence of many a floating casino where you could drink and gamble to your heart’s content, as well as plenty of boats where you could legally buy alcohol for your own personal consumption at home. This activity was referenced to in the Three Mile Limit cocktail, a combination of brandy and rum with a dash of lemon juice and grenadine, invented by “Chips” Brighton, a bartender at the famed Harry’s New York Bar in Paris. This was first documented in Harry McElhone’s 1927 *Barflies and Cocktails* and unintentionally (or not?) renamed the Three Miller 3 years later in Harry Craddock’s 1930 *The Savoy Cocktail Book*.  
As more and more people took advantage of this loophole, thumbing their noses at Prohibition, the United States government decided to make it more difficult for people by lobbying for international waters to not begin until 12 miles out, which was about the “distance a steamer could travel in an hour”, in order to limit it to those with access to a more seaworthy vessel. Of course, this called for a retooling of the Three Mile Limit for those willing to travel 4 times further out to sea, resulting in a couple cocktails referencing this law and the continued teasing of those trying to enforce Prohibition. In *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, we find the Twelve Miles Out cocktail, comprised of equal parts Bacardi rum, Swedish punch, and Calvados, shaken, strained, and garnished with orange peel. However, more popular (though still obscure) is the Twelve Mile Limit, a cocktail originally concocted by Thomas Franklin Fairfax Millard and documented in a newspaper article published in 1934. The Twelve Mile Limit takes the Three Mile Limit, turns the proportions of brandy and rum around, and adds some rye whiskey, resulting in a surprisingly smooth and lively cocktail extremely suitable for an ironic toast to Prohibition, or in our case, the end of it.

The Twelve Mile Limit is a rather unique cocktail, successfully blending three distinct base spirits from sugar cane, rye, and grapes. Because of that, it reminds me of the ever popular Long Island Iced Tea, except the Twelve Mile Limit is way classier and has a lot of interesting history to it. This cocktail comes out pleasantly pink from the grenadine with a nose of lemon oil, fruit, and a touch of rum funk. Despite its disparate ingredients (I challenge you to think of other cocktails utilizing two of these base spirits other than a [Vieux Carré](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1a8cs5/not_cocktail_of_the_week_10_vieux_carr%C3%A9/)), it is surprisingly balanced and magically works, much like a Long Island Iced Tea. Similarly, it is difficult to pick out the individual contributions of each base spirit, as they blend together into a unique combination on your tongue, but if I try really hard, I can imagine that I first taste the sugary rum and fruity brandy, which then gives way to the sweet and sour contributions of grenadine and lemon, finally finishing with a little malty spice from the rye whiskey and the funky vegetal notes of rum. Again, drawing parallels with the Long Island Iced Tea, it goes down way too smoothly and very light on the tongue, and similarly it is best when nice and cold. Convenient, then, that it is so tasty and easy to drink.  

**Cheers!**  
While we no longer need to go 12 miles offshore to enjoy a cocktail, with all the stress the holiday season entails (and all of the in-laws and relatives), we may wish to go 12 miles away. That said, hopefully the Twelve Mile Limit will help relieve some of this stress and I invite you to toast with me to Repeal Day on December 5th. If you still haven’t gotten around to making your own grenadine, find my recipe for it in my write-up for the [Jack Rose](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1bnysd/not_cocktail_of_the_week_13_jack_rose/). Between that, the [Scofflaw](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1r389k/not_cocktail_of_the_week_46_scofflaw/) from a couple weeks ago, and this week’s cocktail, you should have plenty of excuses to make and use some homemade grenadine. Feel free to leave me any messages you wish in the comments below, I look forward to hearing about those enjoying this week’s NCotW and seeing any pictures you wish to share. A few weeks left until Christmas and the one year mark of this weekly feature in /r/cocktails. Crazy! In any case, until next week, cheers!
