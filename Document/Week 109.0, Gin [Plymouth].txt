**Not Cocktail of the Week #109: Bijou**  
For NCotW this week, I want to return to a classic cocktail that I’ve been meaning to write about for years, the Bijou. This post has been long overdue but with the breakneck pace of NCotW the last two years, I never had the opportunity to explore and adjust the Bijou to my taste. As my recent fling with Green Chartreuse coincided with a similarly recent trip to Bourbon & Branch, I ended up with a Bijou in front of me one evening and concluded that it was time for me to get down to writing about the Bijou. 

**Background**  
The Bijou is typically attributed to the bartender Harry Johnson, as he published it in the 1900 edition of *Bartender’s Manual*. However, *The PDT Cocktail Book* credits this drink to a C.F. Lawlor in *The Mixicologist*, published in 1895. A bit more research turned up that indeed there was a Bijou cocktail in *The Mixicologist*, but it calls for Grand Marnier instead of Green Chartreuse, which would yield a very different drink. It is possible that Harry Johnson ran with that idea and elevated it to the Bijou we know today. While it may seem insensitive of me to speculate and entertain such a theory, David Wondrich spends a solid two pages of *Imbibe* questioning the legacy of Harry Johnson in his own write-up of the Bijou cocktail. From what I gather, Harry Johnson was rather prone to self-aggrandizing, whether in describing his bar, claiming it to be “the largest and finest establishment of the kind in this country”; his book, of which no trace of the original printing of “ten thousand copies” can be found; or his brilliance, in inventing “the gin sour, the mint julep and the cocktails”. Regardless of his character, it is his version of the Bijou that has persisted until today and it is undoubtedly a drink of note, being one of the early successful cocktails utilizing sweet vermouth, residing alongside the Manhattan and Martinez. It is believed that the name Bijou, French for “jewel”, comes from the colors of its three primary components: gin representing diamond, Chartreuse representing emerald, and sweet vermouth representing ruby.

**Results**  
Naturally, I started with the classic recipe, using equal parts of Beefeater gin, Dolin Rouge, and Green Chartreuse with a dash of orange bitters. This classic Bijou has a bright citrus and clean herbal nose. In the mouth, it is dominated by the sweet herbal flavor of Chartreuse, tempered by gin botanicals. The Chartreuse persists through to the finish, making it hard to get much other flavor. This might be suitable as an after-dinner drink as it is sweet and herbal, akin to sipping on a digestif and perhaps more easily consumed than Chartreuse straight (though I personally have no issue with that).  
More recently I was served a Bijou at Bourbon & Branch by /u/AlmightyJ, as per my request for something to satisfy my craving for Green Chartreuse. Following the spec I drunkenly remembered and wrote down, I made a version of it with Beefeater gin and my house sweet vermouth (a 1:1 blend of Dolin and Punt e Mes), finished with a lemon twist. This version is more suited for the modern palate as it uses more gin and less Chartreuse. The nose of this version still retained a clean and bright citrus note, but was definitely drier and less assertively herbal. Upon sipping, it still started with the unique blend of herbal flavors characteristic of Chartreuse, but in this case, it was only readily apparent up front rather than dominating the drink outright. In this case, the gin gave a strong botanical backbone with the relatively assertive sweet vermouth coming through on each swallow. Personally while others feel a juniper-forward gin such as Beefeater is well-suited for standing up to the Green Chartreuse component of the Bijou, in this case I found it to throw the drink off balance making it a bit too dry. Later questioning revealed that Bourbon & Branch uses Plymouth gin and Carpano Antica, so perhaps I was on the right track, in that it needed a less juniper-forward gin and/or lacked the rich sweet vanilla notes of Carpano Antica.  
Unfortunately, I’ve recently run out of Carpano Antica, but wanted to continue exploring the Bijou, so I took another crack at the Bourbon & Branch spec, but using Plymouth gin and Dolin Rouge, seeking a lighter and fruitier backbone to accompany the herbal Chartreuse. I also added a cherry to the expressed lemon twist as garnish, as specified in the original recipe. This version started with a familiar clean lemon note, but less of a juniper note. It definitely succeeded in being a light and refreshing Bijou, again starting with the sweet herbal notes of Green Chartreuse, but transitioning nicely to the citrusy notes of Plymouth in the body, an interlude of fruity vermouth, and finishing with a flurry of herbal notes from both the vermouth and Chartreuse. While its flavors may be light and fruity, it is still a strong drink with the significant portion of gin and often overlooked Green Chartreuse weighing in at 100-proof. The cherry here was an unexpectedly pleasant hit of intense fruit that transformed the drink to a drier and more herbal profile.  
Wanting a touch more Chartreuse character, I finally gave the Bartender’s Choice version a shot, as it slightly increases the portion of Green Chartreuse and adds an additional dash of orange bitters.  This again had a pleasant lemon nose, but I did note an additional bit of orange, likely from the orange bitters. In the mouth it started up front with the herbal and invigorating flavor of Green Chartreuse, as desired, but still balanced it well with the gin and vermouth which asserted themselves in the body of the drink, and finished with a mild citrus note. This was another solid version, well-balanced for the modern palate.  

**Cheers!**  
Apparently it’s been about 6 months since the last time I wrote about a cocktail using Green Chartreuse, which explains my recent obsession with it. Thanks as usual for reading and hopefully you’ll be able to try a Bijou sometime soon, whether by your own hand or someone behind the bar. If you do, I’d love to hear how you ended up enjoying it. Until next time, cheers!
