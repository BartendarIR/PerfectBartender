**Not Cocktail of the Week #98: Harvard**  
After the relatively complex, but utterly delicious, modern cocktail from last week, I thought it would be nice to turn around and present a simple classic that has recently captured my interest. The Harvard is essentially a brandy-based Manhattan with the addition of a splash of soda water and while a cocktail most anyone with a decently stocked home bar can make, is rarely encountered. Hopefully this post will convince you to give it a try. 

**Background**  
The Harvard, reportedly named after the Ivy League school, dates back to 1895 in George Kappeler’s *Modern American Drinks*, a contemporaneous work with Jerry Thomas’ venerated *Bartender’s Guide: How To Mix Drinks*. I was not able to unearth much about the history of this cocktail other than its association with Harvard University and am not even sure if this cocktail is or ever was popular there. Perhaps the bigger question is why did the whiskey-based Manhattan come into such prominence while the brandy-based Harvard disappeared into obscurity? A question for David Wondrich to tackle one day, I’m sure.

**Recipes**

**Results**  
While the original recipe calls for equal parts brandy and vermouth, I elected to go with a more modern ratio basing it off my preferred [Manhattan](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/16pciv/not_cocktail_of_the_week_2_the_manhattan/) recipe, using 2 oz brandy, 0.75 oz sweet vermouth, 2 dashes Angostura bitters, and finishing it off with 0.5 oz soda water. I’ve never understood why recipes rarely specify an amount of soda water, usually only instructing one to “top with seltzer” or “splash of soda”, when the amount of soda water will significantly affect the ultimate dilution and flavor of the drink. I felt that 0.5 oz was about the limit I could get away with while not making the drink seem overly dilute but still finding its contribution detectable. This first version had a nose very familiar nose with the combination of the fruit and herbal nose from Dolin Rouge and the spices from Angostura bitters as I encounter in a Manhattan. Texturally this was light-bodied and surprisingly refreshing for appears to be a weighty cocktail due to the addition of soda water. The flavor progression was also a bit surprising as well, starting with the herbal notes from vermouth, but transitioning first to the spiciness of Angostura bitters before settling into the warm fruit and caramel flavors of brandy, and finishing with a return of the Angostura bitters though more of the bitter notes. Ultimately this was a lighter and very enjoyable brandy version of a Manhattan.  
I was very intrigued by the earlier appearance and more prominent flavor of Angostura in the previous version which I attributed to the effects of soda water and wanted to explore this phenomenon a bit more. Since brandy and Peychaud’s go very well together in the original [Sazerac](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1zk37d/not_cocktail_of_the_week_61_special_mardi_gras/), I replaced the Angostura with Peychaud’s figuring it’d end up somewhere between the Sazerac and Manhattan. This was also a very interesting and enjoyable experience, a bit spicier on the nose with that forward pepperiness and a note I describe as dusty from the Peychaud’s. Flavor-wise it was very different with the spicier Peychaud’s apparent up front, followed by the herbal sweet vermouth, transitioning to the fruity brandy, and finishing with a return of the Peychaud’s as an anise note. If I were to try this again, I think it would be interesting to try this version sans soda water.   
I finally wanted to see how the more intense and bitter Punt e Mes would affect this drink compared to the lighter and fruity Dolin Rouge. The combination of the herbal notes and Angostura bitters in the nose still reminds me of a nice Manhattan. Its flavor was quite distinct from the first version and I described it as much darker, bitter, spicier and complex. This version of the Harvard felt more wintery to me, but it was still a relatively light-bodied cocktail due to the slight effervescence. In terms of flavor, I found the Punt e Mes and Angostura spices up front, a combination of Angostura with fruity brandy in the middle, and returning to the herbal vermouth and Angostura bitterness on the finish.

**Cheers!**  
While relatively light on the history, a simple classic cocktail like this is always amenable to interesting modifications and can really demonstrate the effect that changing a single ingredient has on the final product. I hope that some of you will be able to try some version of the Harvard and share your own personal modifications and preferences here. As usual, all your comments, questions, discussions, and support are appreciated. /u/BadgerPriest recently posted a [call of support](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2mrg7l/reminder_not_cocktail_of_the_week_book_campaign/) for the “Not Cocktail of the Week” book that I’m trying to get funded on redditmade, so check it out if you haven’t yet had the chance. They finally updated the page with a couple thumbnails of what the interior should look like so take a look [here](https://redditmade.com/campaign/not-cocktail-of-the-week-book). I’ll be out of the country next week, but hopefully some sort of guest post will show up at the regularly appointed time. See you all in a couple weeks, cheers!
