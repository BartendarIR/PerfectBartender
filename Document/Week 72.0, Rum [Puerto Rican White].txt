**Not Cocktail of the Week #72: Mary Pickford**  
A relatively short post this week as I am running a bit thin on ideas at the moment, but with a guest post scheduled for next week, hopefully I’ll have an opportunity to get caught up a bit and find some great new stuff to write about. In any case, for this week’s NCotW, I wanted to share a classic that is well-suited for spring/summer drinking, the Mary Pickford. 

**Background**  
I first stumbled across this cocktail while helping a friend seeking a signature cocktail for her wedding that used both white rum and pineapple, while not being a Pina Colada. While there are plenty of Tiki style drinks that might fit that bill, it seemed unlikely that your typical wedding venue bartender would take the time and effort to properly execute a good Tiki drink, but in the process of my search I came across this relatively simple classic. While she ultimately elected not to have cocktails at her wedding, the Mary Pickford is still a nice refreshing cocktail that I’ve come to enjoy.  
The creation of the Mary Pickford is most commonly attributed to Eddie Woelke, a legendary bartender at the famed Jockey Bar in Havana, who fled to Cuba during Prohibition. Better known for his creation of the El Presidente cocktail (conveniently discussed recently in /r/cocktails [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/25wqv5/experience_with_el_presidente/)), Eddie Woelke also created the Mary Pickford in the 1920s, naming it after the famed silent movie star of the same name. A parallel origin story attributes the Mary Pickford cocktail to the barman Fred Kaufman at the Hotel Sevilla in Havana, where Mary Pickford apparently frequented while filming a movie with Charlie Chaplin and her husband Douglas Fairbanks.  
While most (including myself) are unfamiliar with the actress Mary Pickford, she was known as “America’s Sweetheart” and was one of the first female media celebrities. In her time, she was probably the most famous woman in the whole world. Along with Charlie Chaplin and her soon-to-be second husband, Douglas Fairbanks, she founded the film studio United Artists, which is now owned by MGM. While her popularity rapidly faded with the advent of “talkies”, as a co-founder of United Artists, she remained one of the most powerful women in Hollywood. Though her fame as a silent movie star may have been lost in this modern age, her name and legacy are immortalized by this cocktail created in her honor.

**Results**  
The recipe for a Mary Pickford has shifted pretty significantly over the years, as it was apparently first recorded as 2/3 pineapple juice, 1/3 Bacardi, with a dash of grenadine in Basil Woon’s 1928 book, *When it’s Cocktail Time in Cuba*. By 1930, it was recorded in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* as equal parts rum and pineapple juice, with a dash of grenadine and a handful of drops of maraschino. Tasting this version, I found a nose dominated by pineapple and a flavor to match. While very light and refreshing, I was unable to detect any contribution from the maraschino liqueur or grenadine in this cocktail.   
Moving forward to a more modern recipe from *Imbibe Magazine*, I mixed up a Mary Pickford with 2 parts white rum, 1 part pineapple juice, and a barspoon each of grenadine and maraschino liqueur. The nose of this cocktail remained relatively unchanged from the first version, but I did feel this was a more interesting cocktail while still being very approachable. It starts with a clear pineapple flavor tempered by the unique woody notes of maraschino liqueur and finishing with a pretty distinct rum note.  
Finally, I tried the version found in *Bartender’s Choice*, which ups the maraschino liqueur and grenadine to 0.25 oz. In this last version, I definitely detected a maraschino note in the nose mingling with the expected pineapple. The additional thickness from the increased maraschino liqueur and grenadine gives this version a very pleasant creamy and full texture. With the flavor of maraschino much more apparent, this cocktail is sweet and complex, starting first with pineapple flavor, which is then transformed by the entrance of the maraschino flavor, finishing with the dry sugary notes of rum and a lingering bitterness from the rum and maraschino. Still, I am unsure what the grenadine contributes, other than the slight tint of color. I really enjoyed this version, but personally found the maraschino flavor a bit too strong. It is a difficult balance to strike as the complex flavor brought by the maraschino liqueur is what keeps this cocktail from come off too sweet. So depending on how much you enjoy the flavor of maraschino liqueur, I would recommend either of these two modern versions using either a barspoon or 0.25 oz of it.  

**Cheers!**
