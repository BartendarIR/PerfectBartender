**Not Cocktail of the Week #76: Gimlet**  
It’s hard to believe I haven’t yet covered the Gimlet in NCotW. It is a cocktail that I have a very strong memory association from four years ago when I was just getting my feet wet in the world of cocktails. I have a clear memory of sipping one of these on the back porch on a sunny summer day in Seattle while reading Anthony Bourdain’s *Medium Raw*. It’s a great cocktail for beginners, but is also very amenable to variation by those with more experience (and more extensive bar cabinets).  

**Background**  
The Gimlet is believed to be another concoction originally born of the need to prevent scurvy, but unlike the rum-based Grog given to sailors (as mentioned last week), the Gimlet was the drink for officers of the British Royal Navy that preferred the taste of gin from home. Credit for the Gimlet and its name is most commonly attributed to the Sir Thomas D. Gimlette, Surgeon General in the British Royal Navy. The Gimlet traditionally used a lime cordial such as Rose’s, a product from Lauchlan Rose, who pioneered a way to preserve lime juice sans alcohol in 1867 using sulfur dioxide. This coincides well with Sir Thomas Gimlette’s stint in the Navy from 1879-1913. Whether Rose’s product was actually carried and used on naval vessels is another story entirely, as despite people attributing the rise of using the non-alcoholic Rose’s to the coincident Merchant Shipping Act of 1867, that act actually had nothing to do with promoting a non-alcoholic lime juice, but conversely stipulated that lemon and lime juice be fortified with a minimum 15% “proper and palatable proof spirits”. So it actually seems that Mr. Rose was looking to expand his market, perhaps into those involved in the growing Temperance Movement. Whatever the story, the Gimlet has persisted for over a hundred years as a classic cocktail that doesn’t get much simpler, at its most basic needing two ingredients total, but still allowing for experimentation, as evidenced by the multitude of personal variations that exist today.

**Results**  
In the process of writing this week’s post, I realized my idea of a Gimlet dates myself to the earlier part of the modern cocktail revival. At that time, classic drinks like the Gimlet were being rediscovered and the thought of using a preserved processed lime juice was repugnant, so most bars and bartenders turned to fresh lime juice and simple syrup, as those are the primary ingredients of a lime cordial. More recently it seems that in order to better capture the character of this drink, people are taking a second look at lime cordial and while Rose’s is still not a quality product, making their own as an alternative. I have to admit this seems like a better approach than just lime and simple syrup which many argue result in a simple Gin Sour, but as I learned to love Gimlets in that fashion, I wanted to go through them both.  
I first did a Gimlet the way I usually would using Beefeater as a crisp juniper-forward gin with fresh lime juice and cane sugar syrup. This version had an appealing sweet and herbal nose of gin botanicals, juniper, and lime. On the palate, it was very crisp and sharp-edged, bringing to mind how some people believe the Gimlet is named after the sharp tool used to drill taps in barrels. In terms of its flavor, I first got the bitter notes from lime tempered with sugar up front, immediately transitioning into the tart notes nicely balanced with sweet cane sugar. The gin backbone shows up for me in the middle, with an assertive herbal flavor that lingers on the palate through to the finish, which reintroduces a bit of fruit. This is an assertive sour that sticks to your mouth long after you swallow. I also briefly did a version using Hendrick’s gin as an experiment, which served to affirm that an assertive and more juniper-forward gin is better in this drink as the subtleties of the more subdued Hendrick’s gin are not able to stand up to the lime juice and while it brings forward some more floral notes in the lime juice, it ends up being slapped around and drowns in the milieu.  
After doing a bunch of reading and research, I discovered that recently the trend seems to be swinging back towards using a proper lime cordial, so I tried to approximate that using a really quick 10-minute recipe from *The PDT Cocktail Book*, which you can find below. I went with Plymouth in this case as a more citrus-forward and potentially more historically accurate choice. The nose of this is much less assertive with a subtle herbal fresh note with a juniper note that is not immediately evident. Upon sipping, I first get a flavor of fresh lime peel, followed by a big hit of sugar, finishing with the pleasantly complementary gin botanicals. However, with this recipe dialing back on the lime juice, I found it too sweet for my taste, so if I were to do it again I would use my usual 2:1:0.75 ratio, either steeping the lime zest longer for more flavor or trying one of the more interesting recipes I’ve come across. I also am a fan of tasting new ingredients straight to get a better handle on their flavor, so I did taste the quick lime cordial and found that other than the color difference, it had a subtle difference in flavor with some lime zest apparent up front as well as a note of lime on the nose. How it compares to Rose’s I do not know, but as I know I’ll definitely be trying a couple different recipes when I have the chance.

**Variations**  
Over the years, the Gimlet has been tinkered with by countless bartenders and I’m reasonably confident that most any cocktail bar has some in-house version of the Gimlet. These most often take the form of changing the sweetener by infusing floral, herbal, fruity, or other flavors into the simple syrup, but can also be accomplished by substituting a liqueur in its place altogether. Fresh ingredients are also often found worked into a Gimlet, with the [Richmond Gimlet](http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2004/the-richmond-gimlet/) from Jeffrey Morgenthaler that adds mint, or one of the countless rediscoveries of adding cucumber to a Gimlet made with Hendrick’s being two of the most popular. Of course, changing the gin used can have a significant effect on the final drink and now that I’m writing this, I’m wondering why I’ve never tried this with genever…
