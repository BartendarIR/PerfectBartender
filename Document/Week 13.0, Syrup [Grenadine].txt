**Not Cocktail of the Week #13: Jack Rose**  
Apologies for the post being late this week, I was away Monday and it managed to throw off my sense for what day of the week it is. For this week’s column, I elected to write about the Jack Rose, a very simple and delicious, yet underappreciated cocktail, that requires only one classic bottle in your bar.  

**Background**  
The Jack Rose, alongside the Old Fashioned, Manhattan, Martini, Sidecar, and Daiquiri cocktails, is one of the six basic drinks outlined in David Embury’s *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks* from 1948. Though I do not personally own the book, it is a great cocktail book that covers many of the more abstract concepts and principles of mixing drinks. His approach towards making cocktails is very spirit-forward, with a basic recipe of 8:2:1 spirit:sour:sweet for the Daiquiri, Sidecar, and Jack Rose, which may appeal to the more modern palate. The [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fine_Art_of_Mixing_Drinks) on it does a pretty good job of summarizing its key points, so if you find it interesting, you should definitely pick it up.  
Getting back to the normal content of my “Background” sections, as with many classic cocktails, the historical origins of the Jack Rose cocktail, whether the man or meaning behind its name, are both myriad and mysterious. The most colorful story revolves around the infamous New York City mobster, Jacob Rosenweig whose many alias’ were variations on Jack Rose. He ran a gambling resort known as the Rosebud in east Manhattan, and perhaps it is there that his character lays claims to the origins of the Jack Rose cocktail. There is a seedy story accompanying Mr. Rosenweig which I won’t go into in this column, but it involves assassination, framing of a police officer, perjury, and the ultimately execution of an innocent man. A friendly and simpler story about the origins of the Jack Rose cocktail is that it was named after its pink hue, which is close to that of the Jacquemot rose, in the Old Waldorf Bar in 1931. There are a couple more individuals worth mentioning known as Jack Rose that also lay claim to the origins of this cocktail, one being Joseph Rose, a restaurateur in New Jersey who once had the title of “World’s Champion Mixologist”; another being a Frank J. May aka Jack Rose, who worked as a bartender in Jersey City, who was accredited with this cocktail in 1905 in the *National Police Gazette*. Both of these individuals hail from New Jersey, the home of applejack, which does add a little to the veracity of these claims. Finally, perhaps the simplest explanation for the Jack Rose cocktail discards with the idea that it is named after someone or something at all, instead being a catchy combination of its ingredients, apple**jack** and the **rose** color imparted by grenadine.  
One of many interesting facts about applejack (which I’m sure I will write about in more detail in a future column): Laird’s applejack (the sole producer of applejack today) was supplied to the troops at Valley Forge.  

**Recipes**

**Results**  
My initial experience with a Jack Rose was also the first time I tried applejack, a spirit I was very curious about. In chatting up the bartender on a slow night, I ended up inadvertently finding the Jack Rose cocktail in a book and ordered one, ultimately though I cannot remember the recipe he used, I found it to be too sour. My second experience with the Jack Rose cocktail was before I had gotten around to making grenadine and mistakenly thought Chambord would be a suitable substitute. That ended up being an oddly earthy drink and not very enjoyable. Since then, I have made a proper Jack Rose cocktail a number of times and have found that despite its simplicity, this is a really delicious sour cocktail. The old recipe from *The Savoy Cocktail Book* and the modern recipe in *The PDT Cocktail Book* actually come pretty close to each other, though between these two recipes, there is quite a bit of variation. I generally end up using a 3:1:1 ratio of applejack:lemon:grenadine, sometimes being slightly heavy handed with the applejack. Upon tasting a Jack Rose cocktail, I first get the warm and sweet apple-y aromas of applejack contrasting with the sour tang of lemon. This is immediately reflected in its flavor profile as it is sipped, which start fruity and sweet before the sour of lemon hits the back of your tongue, and finally the finishes with the body that applejack imparts.  

**Variations**  
Something that I was thinking about the other day is about why grenadine is a relatively popular cocktail ingredient. As I will detail below, it is essentially sweetened pomegranate juice. What if we used other sour juices in a similar fashion? I haven’t thought much more beyond that, but if you have interesting ideas, I’d love to expand on this notion. Maybe pineapple, cherry, blueberry, or strawberry juices could be experimented with?  
The Jack Rose cocktail does already have some variation built into it, as there is significant variation in the ratios of its ingredients. Some recipes call for lime juice which, although more assertive, does mesh well with grenadine. If you enjoy a different recipe for your Jack Rose cocktail, please share with the rest of us in comments.  

**Grenadine**  
The grenadine that is found for purchasing in stores, most often Rose’s, is basically artificially colored and artificially flavored corn syrup. There is really no reason for its existence these days as real grenadine can be made at home with very little effort, and with just a little effort, you can easily make a superb one as well. Grenadine essentially boils down (so clever) to sweetened pomegranate juice, which although once difficult to obtain other than from freshly juicing pomegranates (conveniently difficult to obtain as well), has gotten a lot easier with the popularity of the POM brand of pomegranate juice. I will share a few recipes for grenadine that get progressively more complex depending on how invested you are.  
*Normal Mode*  
* 1 part POM pomegranate juice  
* 1 part granulated sugar  
Shake in a bottle until dissolved, store in refrigerator  
This is what I usually end up making, since I don’t have to bother with using a pot on the stove and pouring things back and forth, but I do add a few drops of orange flower water to it at the end to add a little complexity. In addition, this is super easy to make in small batches to prevent spoilage.  
*Hard mode* via [Jeffrey Morgenthaler](http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2009/how-to-make-your-own-grenadine/)  
* 2 cups fresh or POM pomegranate juice  
* 2 cups unbleached sugar  
* 2 oz pomegranate molasses  
* 1 tsp orange flower water  
Heat juice slightly, until sugar dissolves. Add pomegranate molasses and stir to dissolve in the warm syrup. Allow to cool, add orange flower water, stir and store in refrigerator.   
I’ve not used this recipe as I don’t have pomegranate molasses in my pantry, but it is apparently relatively easy to find in your local Mediterranean or Latin American market. In a pinch, you could make pomegranate molasses at home, but if you are willing to do that, just go with the recipe below.  
*Expert mode* via [12bottlebar](http://12bottlebar.com/syrups/)  
* 1 part POM pomegranate juice  
* 2 parts sugar  
* Orange flower water  
* Rose water  
Mix the juice and sugar in a pot on very low heat until dissolved. Remove 3/4 of the rich syrup from the stove and heat the remainder on medium heat until reduced in volume by half, essentially making your own pomegranate molasses. Mix the two portions together and add a few drops each of orange flower water and rose water.  
A couple tips about this recipe as I used this for my first batch of grenadine. Firstly, do not forget conservation of mass as when things dissolve into a liquid, the total volume will increase. I used an entire small bottle of POM pomegranate juice and ended up filling an entire empty 750 mL liquor bottle with grenadine which was way too much to use (although cheap). Secondly, getting the reduced portion to mix into the initial portion is not easy as it will begin to harden as it cools due to its high sugar content. Perhaps this would be best done back on the stove? A final note: as this is essentially a 2:1 rich syrup, it probably doesn’t need to be stored in the refrigerator, but if you do it will be quite thick.
