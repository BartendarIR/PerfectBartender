**Not Cocktail of the Week #115: Sweet and Vicious**  
Another drink from *Death & Co.* this week, I’ve got one (maybe two) more that I want to share, hopefully people aren’t getting too tired of all these fantastic modern drinks. I really like this one because as a native Seattleite, I love apples. While there are some terrific apple brandies, none quite capture the unique flavor of a fresh apple, especially in cocktail form. I’ve always had the idea to try and replicate a fresh apple flavor in a cocktail using apple brandy, but after trying the Sweet and Vicious, perhaps the straightforward approach of fresh muddled apple is the way to go. 

**Background**  
The Sweet and Vicious was concocted for Death & Co. (duh) in 2008 and comes to use courtesy of Alex Day. In his words, “Using muddled apples quickly infuses this variation on the Manhattan with their bright, yeasty flavor, giving it a light quality.” It is pretty interesting to see this classified as a take on a Manhattan, but upon closer examination you can see the classic Death & Co. approach of splitting an ingredient into two components as the Dolin dry vermouth and Amaro Nonino take the place of sweet vermouth. Concepts like this really open up new possibilities and demystify some of the processes behind making new cocktails.  

**Recipes**  
*Death & Co.*, David Kaplan, 2014  
* 2 Fuji apple slices  
* 2 oz Old Overholt rye  
* 0.5 oz Dolin dry vermouth  
* 0.5 oz Amaro Nonino  
* 1 tsp maple syrup  
* Garnish: 1 apple fan  
In a mixing glass, gently muddle the apple slices. Add the remaining ingredients and stir over ice. Double strain into a coupe and garnish with the apple fan.

**Results**  
I’m not sure why it’s so rare to find muddled apple in cocktails, perhaps their relative toughness compared to soft berries makes them less attractive in a professional bar setting. However, I’ve not found any way to properly recreate the unique qualities of a fresh apple as I find even unpasteurized fresh apple cider overly sweet and lacking the mild dry tartness of a fresh apple. Perhaps juice prepared a la minute might work, but that seems like even more work than a quick muddle. I should also note that I used Grade B maple syrup. For those unaware, maple syrup grades are not a measure of quality, but instead their color which indicates how strong its flavor is. Grade B has a much richer and robust maple flavor than Grade A and still remains relatively easy to find at most groceries. If you’ve never tried Grade B maple syrup to accompany your breakfast items, you’re missing out.   
All ramblings aside, my brief tasting notes for the first Sweet and Vicious were “Fresh peel aroma, bright tart apple flavor, light maple sweetness, brief bitterness.”  My more concerted efforts in tasting and recording thoughts on following sessions find that the Sweet and Vicious starts with the fresh apple aroma I love from both the apple fan garnish and the muddled apple accompanied by a light floral spiciness from the Old Overholt. While not as full-bodied as other drinks with muddled fruit like the [Muddled Mission](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/34b35t/not_cocktail_of_the_week_113_muddled_mission/), it does have a moderate body from the combination of apple, Amaro Nonino and maple syrup. In terms of its flavors, I find it starts with the sweet flavors up front with apple contributing fruit, maple adding sugary depth and Amaro Nonino providing a mild complexity. The Amaro Nonino bridges the gap to the body which I found briefly herbal with the dry vermouth asserting itself here. The relatively mild Old Overholt rye comes through at the end, with its dry fruitiness combining well with the fresh apple. I’m not entirely sure how to garnish with an apple fan appropriately, I found it rather difficult to drink with the large garnish (am I supposed to set it aside?), but it did look quite nice and provides an additional olfactory component. I did rather enjoy having the thin slices of the apple to eat as a perfectly paired palate refresher. 

**Cheers!**  
Thanks for reading, hopefully you’ve enjoyed learning about another cocktail from *Death & Co.* and will have a chance to enjoy one yourself soon. I’d love to hear about any other delicious apple cocktails people have come across along with the usual conversations in the comments section. Apologies for my relative scarceness and brevity, as I’ve been entirely too engrossed with The Witcher 3. I’m still looking for people that might want to help me write NCotW for /r/cocktails that would allow for more frequent posts, but either way I’ll continue these at my own pace. Cheers!
