**Not Cocktail of the Week #116: Kingston Negroni**  
As I’m sure most of you are aware at this point, it is Negroni Week! When you go to any of the participating bars listed on negroniweek.com and have a Negroni, they will donate $1 to their chosen charity. This week, I wanted to contribute to the Negroni Week festivities by sharing one of the most famous variations on the Negroni from the *Death & Co.* book and another modern classic, the Kingston Negroni. 

**Background**  
The Kingston Negroni is credited to Joaquin Simo, who is rapidly becoming a familiar name in NCotW as he is also the man responsible for creating the [Latin Quarter](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2vkgdm/not_cocktail_of_the_week_107_latin_quarter/) and [Muddled Mission](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/34b35t/not_cocktail_of_the_week_113_muddled_mission/). He first concocted this drink in 2009 and describes the creation of it in his own words. 

>“I created this Negroni variation immediately after I first tasted Smith & Cross rum. Only Carpano Antica has the balls to stand up to its intensity.”  

This cocktail really highlights and requires the intense Jamaican rum character of Smith & Cross and is thus named after the capital city of Jamaica, Kingston.   

**Recipes**  
*Death & Co.*, David Kaplan, 2014  
* 1 oz Smitth & Cross rum  
* 1 oz Carpano Antica Formula sweet vermouth  
* 1 oz Campari  
* Garnish: 1 orange twist  
Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into a double rocks glass. Garnish with the orange twist.

**Results**  
Certain cocktails are amenable to substitution, but this is not one of those. It balances three intense flavors: the crazy ester character of Smith & Cross rum, the bold bitterness of Campari and the pungent herbal notes of Carpano Antica. Much like a three-legged stool, if any of these flavor components are short, the drink will be unbalanced and likely simply not work.  
My initial brief tasting notes for the Kingston Negroni describe it as, “Wild funky fruity nose with notes of orange, banana and Campari. Intense! Strong hogo and Campari, bitter sugar finish.” Hogo is a term that I see reserved primarily for describing Smith & Cross’ strong ester character. It is an intense version of the funkiness you get in Jamaican rum, which evokes cooked banana and spoiled fruit in my mind. With a more focused tasting of the Kingston Negroni, I still get that funky fruitness up front along with a citrusy sweetness from the orange peel tinged with an herbal complexity from Campari. In the mouth, it starts with a brief fruity hogo note before the robust citrus bitterness of Campari enters. This combines with the intense and unique fruitiness of Smith & Cross before finishing with the rich vanilla and bitter herbal notes of Carpano Antica. Compared to a normal Negroni, this one forgoes the dry herbal character of gin and instead hits you in the face with funky fruity rum. 

**Cheers!**  
I think this is the best variation on a Negroni that I’ve enjoyed and is something I actually have with some regularity. If you can get ahold of the ingredients, you should definitely give it a shot. This is probably the last *Death & Co.* post for a little while, I’ve spent the last couple months sharing my favorite recipes from it and maybe convinced a few of you still lacking this amazing tome to get it. It’s definitely one of the best cocktail books I’ve read and I would consider it a staple for the enthusiast. Hope you enjoyed this brief detour from the usual rotation of classic, simple and modern drinks. Please feel free to share any of your favorite Negroni variations here, I’m a big fan of any and should probably go pick up Gary ‘gaz’ Regan’s book *The Negroni* at some point to find more. Go enjoy Negroni Week, perhaps with a Kingston Negroni! Cheers!
