**Not Cocktail of the Week #40: The Zombie**

With Halloween approaching, I figured there should be a Halloween themed cocktail, hence this weeks Not Cocktail of the Week: The Zombie. Also with premiere of The Walking Dead season 4 this weekend, why not become a Zombie yourself while watching it. Although the Zombie cocktail sounds horrific, it really has nothing to do with Halloween or the rotten-flesh, brain eating stars of many films, books, and video games.  Instead the Zombie is a high-proof complex rum rhapsody, a mix of many rums and fruit juices that has had as many variations as bartenders who have attempted to make them. This Tiki drink was truly the lost Holy Grail of Tiki drinks, that is until Tiki crusader Jeff “Beachbum” Berry uncovered some of the most authentic recipes for this cocktail known to date.

**Background**

The Zombie was invented by one of the founding fathers of Tiki drinks, Don Beach. Don is quoted saying, *"I originated and have served this 'thing' since 1934...Anyone that says otherwise is a liar!"* Despite their differences, Don’s main rival, and the other founding father of Tiki drinks, Vic Bergeron (aka Trader Vic), conceded the origin of the Zombie to Don Beach stating, *"There has been much argument about the origination of the Zombie, but credit should be given where credit is due. Don the Beachcomber, of Hollywood, Chicago, and anywhere in the South Pacific, is the originator of this famous drink.”* The Zombie was created in 1934 reportedly as a hangover cure for a businessman who had an important meeting to get to. The businessman came back to Don’s a few weeks later and when Don asked how he liked the drink the customer replied “I felt like the living dead.”

With the growing popularity of Polynesian restaurants, many people attempted to copy Don’s restaurant style and cocktails. Most utterly failed when attempting to copy his Zombie, due largely to the fact that there is no printed or documented recipe of the Zombie. Don was always secretive about his concoctions, labeling bottles of alcohol, mixed juices, and syrups with numbers and letters, and trusting his bartenders with only limited coded recipes of patterns and symbols. The Zombie grew in popularity after a bartender attempted to copy the famous drink from Don the Beachcombers serving it during the 1939 New York World’s Fair.

Tiki drinks continued to increase in popularity as the fad grew throughout the 40’s and 50’s. The Zombie and many of Don’s other cocktails could be found throughout the United States in most Polynesian restaurants. It wasn’t until the late 1960’s when the counter-culture that killed Tiki drinks and cocktails caused the Zombie begin to disappear. The Zombie became just another drink on a menu in “tacky” Polynesian themed restaurants. Across most of America, who knows what passed as a Zombie, it certainly wasn’t what Don would have his bartenders mix up from coded bottles. Although Tiki restaurant’s are primarily a thing of the past, the modern cocktail revolution has brought new life to these once forgotten drinks. Tiki bars are now opening up all over the country, in fact the city I live in is about get their first Tiki Bar. Although obscure, the Zombie, is not forgotten and is still referenced in many popular cultural mediums even today, from MASH to The Simpsons, and Fats Waller to the rapper Common, the Zombie has influenced many generations. WIth the help of modern Tiki revolutionaries like Jeff “Beachbum” Berry, hopefully quality Zombies will continue to turn perfectly normal people into Zombies.

**Don Beach, the original Beachcomber**

Don Beach was born Ernest Raymond Beaumont-Gannt in Mexia, Texas in February 1907, though the exact day of the month seems to change depending on the source. At 7 years old he moved to Mandeville, Louisiana to live with his grandparents on their plantation. It was there that the young Beachcomber received his education for sailing and acquired a love for the tropics. By the late 1920’s Don had already sailed around the world twice, spending much of his time in the South Pacific and Caribbean. His love for sailing and exotic island booze naturally brought Don into the bootlegging business during Prohibition. In 1931 Don washed up in Southern California, doing odd jobs around Los Angeles, including work as a technical adviser on files set in the South Pacific. 

After the repeal of Prohibition, Don opened up Don’s Beachcomber in an old vacant tailor shop near Hollywood Blvd. It was a small two dozen seat bar decorated with South Pacific gewgaws, old nets, and parts of wrecked boats he scavenged from the oceanfront. Don would often tell his customers, “If you can’t get to paradise, I’ll bring it to you,” and in the midst of the Great Depression, a little sip of paradise went a long way. The bar soon became one of the favorite watering holes to many movie stars, including Charlie Chaplin and Marlene Dietrich. After it’s success, Don opened Don The Beachcomber’s across the street, a full Polynesian themed restaurant serving up Cantonese food and Don’s signature Tiki drinks. When World War II broke out in 1939, Don served in the United States Army and was injured after a U-boat attacked his convoy bound for Morocco. After recovering from his injuries, Don completed his service by operating officer rest and recreation camps at the order of his longtime friend, Lieutenant General Jimmy Doolittle for the war weary airman of the 12th and 15th Air Forces in Capri, Nice, Cannes, the French Riviera, Venice, the Lido and Sorrento. 

When Don returned after the war he had found that his wife had expanded Don the Beachcombers to 16 locations. Unfortunately, when Don and his wife divorced, his wife retained legal ownership over the restaurants and their name, and Don was not allowed to open a Don the Beachcombers in the US. But this did not stop the force of Don the Beachcomber, as he moved to Waikiki, Hawaii (not yet a US State) and opened up his final Beachcombers. As an interesting anecdote, it was here that he rigged a water hose to create the effect of rain on the roof, after he observed late night drinkers would linger for another round if they thought it was raining. Sadly, Don Beach passed away on June 7th 1989, but his legacy and his mark upon popular culture of the 1930s-60s are the Polynesian themed restaurants of yesteryear and many amazing Tiki drinks.
 
**Recipes**

Since there is no single defined Zombie recipe, only variations, this section will highlight some of the more common ones. Some recipes can be traced to more authentic origins and therefore might be more accurate than others. The difficulty with most Tiki drinks is that they contain multiple rums, fruit juices, and often special syrups. I will be covering six recipes from Jeff Berry’s *Beachbum Berry’s Remixed* and one modern recipe. These recipes seem to cover most of the ones I found online. For simplicity check out the Zombie recipe matrix I created [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/ysXqlmB.png). If you are only able to try one variation for this weeks NCotW, I would recommend the Original Zombie. If you lack some of the ingredients, try the Simplified recipe, which removes the hard to find Lemon Hart 151 Demerara Rum, Falernum, one of the rums, Absinthe, and Grenadine.
