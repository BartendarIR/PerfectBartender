**Not Cocktail of the Week #82 – The Cloister Cocktail**
 
I am honored this week to guest post my 4th installment of the NCOTW series. I have been following the series since close to its inception and I feel privileged to continue to be a part of it. This week I present The Cloister Cocktail. I try to work my way through as many light and refreshing cocktails as I can before the leaves begin to change and that brisk Fall air makes its way through DC. Fortunately, we are in the peak of heat right now and the perfect time for this wonderful gin based cocktail.
 
**Background**
 
I was originally introduced to The Cloister when I acquired the PDT Cocktail Book last year. The ingredients immediately grabbed my attention as something I knew I would enjoy. After careful internet research told me otherwise, I decided anyway to comb through many of my older vintage cocktail books in search of The Cloister. I eventually gave up the search. It’s amazing to me that given the ingredients, this cocktail was not enjoyed pre-prohibition. The earliest published recipe for The Cloister appears to have been the Playboy Bartender’s Guide by Thomas Mario in 1971. It appears again in Stan Jones Complete Bar Guide in 1977. More recently, The Cloister was featured by Robert Hess on The Small Screen Network.  It feels much more like a classic drink than its history bares.
 
**Recipes**
 
*Playboy Bartender’s Guide*, Thomas Mario, 1971
 
* 1 1/2 oz Gin
* 1/2 oz Yellow Chartreuse
* 1/2 oz grapefruit juice
* 1/4 oz lemon juice
 
Shake with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass. Garnish with a lemon twist.
 
 *“A contemplative kind of drink, perfect for an autumn sundown.”*
 
*Jones Complete Bar Guide*, Stan Jones, 1977
 
* 2 oz Plymouth Gin
* 3/4 oz Yellow Chartreuse
* 3/4 oz fresh grapefruit juice
* 1/4 oz fresh lemon juice
 
Shake with ice and strain into a coupe or cocktail glass. Garnish with a grapefruit twist.
 
*PDT Cocktail Book*, Jim Meehan, 2011
 
* 1 1/2 oz Gin, Tanqueray
* 1/2 oz Yellow Chartreuse
* 1/2 oz grapefruit juice
* 1/4 oz simple syrup
* 1/4 oz lemon juice
 
Shake, strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with a grapefruit twist.
 
**Results**
 
As you may have noticed, the original recipe from the Playboy Bartender’s Guide omits the use of any sugar.  Out of curiosity I went ahead and tested both variations. In the original version, the botanical Chartreuse notes are much stronger up front and tend to dominate a bit more than I prefer. The syrup in the PDT version does a great job of balancing and elevating both the gin and citrus. Robert Hess prefers Beefeater and Meehan recommends Tanqueray. Either way, it is important to use a London Dry with this cocktail in order to hold up against the strong citrus and chartreuse flavors profiles. I chose to use Beefeater and the juniper really showcased. You also have a choice of garnish between lemon and grapefruit peels. I tried both and preferred the aroma that the lemon oil added. It was also easier to twist the lemon than the grapefruit. I snapped a few grapefruit peels trying to get a good twist. The Cloister drinks very much like an elegant and sophisticated cocktail with a nice unexpected bitter twist.
 
**Variations**
 
The Savoy Cocktail Book offers a St. Germain Cocktail that is very similar to The Cloister but replaces the Gin with more Chartreuse and a nice frothy egg white. I haven’t personally tried this variation but it is very intriguing. I’d love to hear feedback from anyone that’s had this before.
 
*St. Germain Cocktail*

* The Juice of 1/2 Lemon.
* The Juice of 1/4 Grapefruit.
* The White or 1 Egg.
* 1 Liqueur Glass Green Chartreuse. (1 1/2 oz Green Chartreuse)

Shake well and strain into cocktail glass.
 
**Cheers**
 
Thanks for reading this week’s NCOTW. I am glad to have been able to give /u/hebug a week off to catch up. I know he has some great tiki drinks planned for us in the upcoming weeks. For those who have come across The Cloister before, I hope this was a welcome refresher. I imagine though for many that this may have been their first introduction to the cocktail and I hope that you give it a try. The bouquet of aromas is a really nice combination for those who enjoy both gin and chartreuse alike. I’ve read that Green can be substituted successfully for Yellow but you’ll probably have to play with the ratios a bit to get it right. Have a great week! Cheers!
