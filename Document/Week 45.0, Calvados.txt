**Not Cocktail of the Week #45: Harvest Moon**  
For this week’s NCotW, I want to first thank /u/bitcheslovebanjos for sending me a small bottle of Abbott’s bitters, reformulated by Darcy O’Neil of [The Art of Drink](http://www.artofdrink.com/). Being a poor scientist living in an expensive city, I couldn’t justify the expense, but he was generous enough to send me some of his. I promised to share a cocktail using this unique ingredient with a lot of history and I eventually came across the Harvest Moon cocktail, a perfect cocktail that already evokes the autumnal season in its name, and will be this week’s NCotW. 

**Background**  
This modern cocktail is published in *The PDT Cocktail Book* and credited to Daniel Eun in the winter of 2007. It is described as looking like the sky during as the reddish-orange harvest moon rises after sunset. It is a very fitting drink for the fall being strong, complex, and fruity.  
There actually is another Harvest Moon cocktail, from the 1934 edition of *Esquire* as one of the “top 10” most popular cocktails. Though its original recipe never seems to have been recorded, it was rediscovered by Robert Hess [here](http://www.smallscreennetwork.com/video/769/cocktail_spirit_harvest_moon) who came up with a recipe from its description of it being an “applejack sour with orgeat”. I have not yet tasted this cocktail, but will certainly have to in the near future. 

**Recipes**  
*PDT Cocktail Book*, Jim Meehan, 2011  
* 1.5 oz Wild Turkey Rye (sub Rittenhouse rye)  
* 1 oz Lillet Blanc (sub Cocchi Americano)  
* 0.5 oz Laird’s Bonded Apple Brandy  
* 0.25 oz Green Chartreuse  
* 3 dashes Abbott’s bitters or Angostura bitters  
Stirred on ice, strained, garnished with orange twist

[Article](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/10/harvest-moon-cocktail-apple-brandy-rye-recipe.html) about the Harvest Moon via Serious Drinks (not sure why they up the Green Chartreuse to 0.5 oz without explaining the deviance from the original recipe)  

**Results**  
*fruity herbal drinks*  
*twist and turn like leaves falling*  
*abbott’s rise again*  
When tasting the Harvest Moon, my nose first fills with the fruity aroma of orange from the citrus oils and a note of sweet apple from the apple brandy. In the mouth, it is very full-bodied, similar to the Diamondback a few weeks ago, as it does share the basic ingredients of 100 proof rye, 100 proof apple brandy, and 110 proof chartreuse. I first get the sweet herbal flavors of chartreuse, which surprised me because there is only 0.25 oz in there, combined with citrus notes from the orange oil and the bitter orange peel in Lillet. It then matures briefly into the brief spicy character of the rye backbone, finishing with the unique subtle anise that Abbott’s bitters conveys and a little more of the Lillet character peeking through. It has an enjoyable lingering pleasant bitterness on from the combination of rye whiskey and Abbott’s. I think that really just tells me I need to try making a Manhattan with Abbott’s. As a final note, I really should have tried making this with both Abbott’s and Angostura and comparing the two, but I only had the opportunity to do notes for the drink with Abbott’s. Given the subtle qualities of Abbott’s, I would definitely use a lighter hand if using Angostura, perhaps just a dash and a few drops. 

**Abbott’s Bitters**  
I thought I would take this opportunity to share a little of the history of Abbott’s bitters, which I mostly pulled from Darcy O’Neil’s video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ0i3Y9yWMk) and a little from Tempus Fugit’s history of Abbott’s bitters [here](http://abbottsbitters.com/about-abbotts-bitters). I’m to refrain from commenting on the legal issues between these two products, so with that let’s learn a little more about Abbott’s bitters.  
Abbott’s bitters are important in the history of cocktails as it was the original brand of bitters used in the Manhattan cocktail circa 1870. Abbott’s bitters originated in the late 1860s and were originally known as Abbott’s Angostura bitters, until they encountered legal issues with their competing product Dr. J.G.B. Siegert’s Angostura bitters. The company behind Seigert’s were able to successfully acquire exclusive rights to use the name Angostura bitters, which are the Angostura bitters we now know today, and Abbott’s were forced to rename their product to Abbott’s aromatic bitters. Ironically, in legal documentation, Abbott’s demonstrated that they used Angostura bark in their product, which is not present in Angostura bitters, which is instead named after the town of Angostura in which Dr. Siegert first formulated this product (note: Angostura is now known as Ciudad Bolivar). Abbott’s aromatic bitters actually managed to survive the dark time that was Prohibition, lasting as a company through Prohibition until the late 1950s, though it is unclear why they went out of business.  
It may partially be due to the reformulation of their product somewhere in the 1920s to 1940s, along with the recipe that Darcy O’Neil unearthed from a cousin of C.W. Abbott, that formed the basis for Darcy O’Neil’s theory that canella bark was the key ingredient in Abbott’s bitters as it was heavily exported from the Bahamas in the 1860s, but became very scarce due to overharvesting by the 1960s. Canella bark, which was used to treat upset stomachs, has many of the flavor components detected in samples of Abbott’s bitters, such as eugenol, found in cloves, and myristicin, from nutmeg and cinnamon. Darcy O’Neil eventually went to the trouble of obtaining some canella bark, mixing it with the other spices and making a test batch of Abbott’s bitters which were received very positively by Robert Hess and the cocktail historian Ted Haigh. Eventually he ended up going down to Saint Croix and harvesting enough canella bark to make one barrel’s worth of Abbott’s bitters, since Abbott’s bitters are also known for barrel aging. Ultimately, he made the one batch, aging it in a used Four Roses barrel, and ended up with ~1400 bottles, which are being sold by him [here](http://www.artofdrink.com/product/abbotts-original-bitters).  
Tempus Fugit has a competing Abbott’s bitters a recipe from another angostura bark bitters producer based on angostura bark and includes tonka bean, another component detected in Abbott’s bitters. They oxygenate their Abbott’s bitters to accelerate the effects of barrel-aging and have come up with a product that they believe comes closest to their samples of Abbott’s bitters. They have a good track record of quality products, but I can’t speak to how their Abbott’s bitters compare. 

**Cheers!**  
If you enjoyed the [Diamondback](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1pk1iv/not_cocktail_of_the_week_43_diamondback/) from a couple weeks ago, you should definitely try the Harvest Moon which has the addition of Lillet and bitters. It is another great libation to sip and savor in the fall. I again have to express my gratitude to /u/bitcheslovebanjos for the sample of Abbott's bitters.  
If you have any questions, comments, suggestion, or feedback, please feel free to leave it in the comments section where I will do my best to respond. I already have a couple volunteers for guest posts coming up, but I also do have some holiday specials I am trying to put together, but time flies and I’m sure I’ll be sharing those with you in the near future. That said, I’m always open to more collaboration, so if you have a special cocktail that you are willing to share about, drop me a PM. Thanks for reading and cheers!
