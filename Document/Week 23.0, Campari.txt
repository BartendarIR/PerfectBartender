**Not Cocktail of the Week #23: Bitter End**  
I want to start this week’s column with a special thank you to the anonymous contributor that was generous enough to send me a copy of David Embury’s *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*. It is the first cocktail book that I wanted to acquire, but somehow still hadn’t. I’ve started reading it and have found it enormously entertaining and relatable as Mr. Embury was himself never an actual bartender, but a hobbyist that had a passion for good cocktails. I’ve found his views remarkably parallel to my own, which makes me regret not owning this book sooner. Thank you so much to whoever sent this book to me.  

Back to the usual introduction, despite the misleading name, this is not the end of the NCotW series, instead it is a modern cocktail that I came across a couple of years ago and have enjoyed many times with a friend of mine. It is extremely easy to make, though to some it may be an acquired taste, and it is a beer cocktail, making it very well suited to having on a warm day as a refreshingly fortified beer.

**Background**  
There are a number of cocktails that are called the Bitter End, but this one in particular originates from the 2011 New York Times annual summer drinks article, contributed by Ciaran Wiese, bartender at Scott & Co. in Tuscon. At the time, I was living in Seattle and had taken up cocktails as a hobby the year before after being introduced to 12bottlebar.com by my roommate. By the summer of 2011, I had already acquired a bottle of Campari for the delicious [Boulevardier](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/180rvd/not_cocktail_of_the_week_5_boulevardier/) and given the propensity for drinking hoppy IPAs in the Pacific Northwest, this cocktail turned out to be the perfect combination for my roommate and I. Being primarily beer, it was refreshing, it was bitter, it was complex, and it was unique. It continues to be something I enjoy to this day especially when I start to get bored of drinking the same beer from the 24-bottle box I get at Costco. :P

**Recipes**  
* 1 oz Campari (or more for the adventurous palate)  
* 12 oz India Pale Ale  
Pour Campari into pint glass, top with IPA  
Garnish with a lemon twist (which I sadly forgot)  

*Links and Further Reading*  
[Article](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/dining/summer-cocktails-made-simpler.html?_r=0) via the NYTimes   
[Link](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/dining/hop-shot-recipe.html?ref=dining) to the recipe directly  

**Results**  
The nose of this beer cocktail is primarily comprised of the heavy hop component from the IPA, but also has a slight bitter orange note from the Campari that is caught in the head of the beer. When I drink it, I initially get a sweet flavor from the Campari, which then transitions in the familiar resinous hoppiness of IPA, then returns to the sweet and bitter profile of Campari for the finish. In this particular case, since the Sierra Nevada Ruthless Rye IPA is already thick and full textured, I found that the addition of Campari further adds to its smoothness and lends its unique bitter profile to the delicious beer.

**Variations**  
Obviously this cocktail will vary greatly depending on what your preferred IPA is. I normally have this with Deschutes Inversion IPA, which has a more citrusy hop characteristic to it, but I think this beer cocktail works pretty well with any IPA. Give it a shot with your preferred IPA and let me know how it is. I also wonder if Aperol could work in a lighter beer, perhaps with pale ale or kolsch?  

**Cheers!**  
Apologies for the short post this week as I’ve been swamped at work and will continue to be for the next couple weeks. Not to worry though, there should be no interruption in the weekly NCotW feature, with a well-timed guest post soon. Please feel free to share your experience with this cocktail, as well as any questions, comments, or suggestions. I want to close by again extending thanks to my generous anonymous benefactor for the copy of *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*, and if anyone else is wanting to show their appreciation my cocktail book wishlist can be found [here](http://amzn.com/w/LJIN08K4RTJW), or if you want to help upgrade my bar tools, drop me a line and I can share some of the items I’m lusting after on Cocktail Kingdom. Hopefully you enjoyed this week’s column, and until next week, cheers!
