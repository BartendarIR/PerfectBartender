**Not Cocktail of the Week #14: Pegu Club**

Hebug was kind enough to let me do this week’s NCotW on this classic drink.  

**Background**

The Pegu Club (usually pronounced “PEH-goo”) was house cocktail at the Pegu Club (pronounced “PEE-zhoo”), a British gentleman's club in Rangoon, Burma during the colonial era.  It was built in the late 1880's and remained one of the top drinking establishments in the British empire until World War II, when it was burned down by the Japanese.  Fittingly, it was around this time that the Pegu Club Cocktail, which had been popular in the 20's and 30's, fell out of favor and was all but forgotten until it's recent revival.  The club itself was not so lucky- after the war, it was used as an army barracks for a time and has since [fallen into disrepair](http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/27721).

And of course, no discussion of the Pegu Club would be complete without a mention of Audrey Saunder's Pegu Club in New York.  Saunders is, by all accounts, a gin fanatic and named her bar in honor of both the bar and the drink that bares its name.  I've never been there, but by all accounts, they make a damn fine Pegu Club.

**Results**

I tried this with both Tanqueray and Bombay Sapphire for the gin, and Grand Marnier and Patron Citronge for the orange liqueur.  The Tanqueray wasn't bad, but the Bombay was the clear winner.  Its softer, more floral character works much better here than Tanqueray's heavy handed juniper.  Tanqeray Malacca or a New Western gin would probably be mind blowing here.  The liqueurs were much closer.  I preferred the Grand Marnier, but if you're more of a triple sec person, I'd say to use that, even for the recipes that call for curacao.

The first drink was decent, but not great.  It's very dry, more like a gimlet than what most people nowadays would think of as a Pegu Club.  The only possible explanation of the Savoy version, on the other hand, is that at some point Harry Craddock went to the original Pegu Club, had a very bad experience, and was trying to ruin the club's reputation.  It's that bad.  I've never had a drink that was simultaneously cloyingly sweet and overly dry. It's horrible and unbalanced and I have no idea how it made its way into the most classic cocktail manual all time.  The last 2 versions are similar, and I quite like them both.  Ted Haigh's version is tangier while Hess's is drier because it's stirred instead of shaken. 

This drink is pretty flexible about ratios, and it pays to experiment to find the recipe that suits your ingredients and preferences best.  I found plenty of other versions that I omitted for the sake of space.  I played around with it and came up with this:

*CDA's Pegu Club*

* 2oz Bombay Sapphire

* 0.5oz Grand Marnier

* 0.75oz fresh lime juice [EDIT: The limes I used when I made this (I bought a bag solely for this article) were really, really sweet.  You may want to drop it down to 0.5oz or 0.625oz, depending on your limes]

* 1 dash Angostura bitters

* 1 dash Angostura orange bitters

Stir (don't shake!) and strain into a chilled glass.  Garnish with a lime wheel.

**Variations**

Due to the general ubiquity of spirit/liqueur/citrus juice drinks, it's hard to find a variation on the Pegu Club that works and isn't already another drink.  Sub out the lime for lemon and it's a white lady, sans egg white.  Switch the gin for tequila and it's a margarita.  

One thing I tried that I really liked was to drop the orange bitters down to a couple drops and add a dash of orange blossom water.  This has the expected effect of giving the drink a more floral character, but it also brings out some interesting spice notes that weren't there before.  It reminds me of sitting outside on a nice mid-late spring day, after the rainy season has stopped and you start seeing the first hints of summer.  Which happens to be exactly how I enjoyed it.

**Cheers!**
