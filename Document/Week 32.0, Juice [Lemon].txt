**Not Cocktail of the Week #32: Bee’s Knees**  
For this week’s NCotW post, I wanted to share the classic and simple Bee’s Knees, a Prohibition-era cocktail. Although this drink is originally gin-based, it is very amenable to substitution with either white or dark rum, so hopefully this will also be a drink that those more partial to rum can enjoy. 

**Background**  
The origins of the Bee’s Knees are generally accepted as being a concoction of the Prohibition era, especially given its name being commonly used slang in the 1920s for something being “the best” or “top-notch”. Though not written or published anywhere I can find, the Bee’s Knees apparently started as a cocktail comprised of equal parts gin, honey, and lemon juice, which while sounding both overly sweet and sour, was a byproduct of using the poor quality “bathtub gin” that was available and an attempt to mask its flavors both on the palate and the breath. It is generally believed that David Embury’s *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks* was the first published recipe of the Bee’s Knees in 1948, but in doing my usual recipe/history research, I saw that *The PDT Cocktail Book* references a Frank Meier, bartender at the Ritz in Paris, publishing his recipe in *The Artistry of Mixing Drinks* in 1937. A little further digging uncovered research primarily conducted by Erik Ellestad on Savoy Stomp (linked in the links section), finding an even earlier mention of the Bee’s Knees in *World Drinks and How to Mix Them* in 1934 by Bill Boothby, a bartender in San Francisco. Though Frank Meier’s recipe for the Bee’s Knees more closely resembles the drink as we know it today, some credit should probably also go to Bill Boothby as well.

**Results**  
As noted by David Embury, the Bee’s Knees is essentially is a standard Gin Sour substituting honey for the simple syrup. Also of note is the slow increase in sweetness over the last decade or so, with recipes originally calling for a honey syrup comprised of equal parts honey and water to the most recent one calling one comprised of 3 parts honey to 1 part water. Whether this is due to a change in palate or a decline in quality of honey is uncertain, but I think the composition of the honey syrup used in cocktails can be quite variable depending on the type and quality of honey used, so adjust to get the honey syrup and this cocktail to your taste.  
The Bee’s Knees from the spec in the *PDT Cocktail Book* starts off with a nose of sweet honey and fresh flowers. In the mouth I first tasted the flavor of honey, followed by the botanical notes of gin, and finishing with the tartness of lemon. After swallowing, it has a lingering finish of honey and bitter botanicals. I found this to be just slightly tart, so I increased the honey syrup to 1 oz in the variation to follow.

**Variations**  
I came across a few recommended variations on the Bee’s Knees in David Embury’s *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*. Substituting white (Cuban if possible) rum for the gin will result in Honeysuckle cocktail while substituting dark Jamaican rum instead will result in the Honey Bee. 
Though I don’t have Havana Club, I did make a Honeysuckle with my Flor de Cana, upping the honey syrup to 1 oz as previously mentioned. Despite the simple substitution and small change, this cocktail was notably different. Instead of honey in the nose, I mostly get lemon and sugar cane from the rum; and upon sipping, it is a combination of honey and sugar cane flavor up front followed by the actual sweetness of honey and tartness of lemon. I thought it was interesting that the honey and sugar cane flavors seem to amplify each other, resulting in a very flavorful drink. Lacking the herbs and botanicals of gin, this lacked the bitter finish, instead finishing with what I described as a “juicy” sensation. I think when I repeat these cocktails again, I would keep the Honeysuckle at 0.75 oz honey syrup and only up it to 1 oz when using gin.  

**Honey**  
Honey is a delicious product made by honeybees by concentrating the nectar that they collect from flowers. While honeybees primarily consume flower pollen and nectar, they produce and store honey in their hive for times when food is scarce or the weather is too cold to leave the hive. Due to being a concentrated syrup, its osmolarity (woo science nerd) is high enough to inhibit growth of most microorganisms and contributes to its natural antiseptic qualities. As a natural product, the sweetness of honey can vary widely and its flavor depends on the flowers used. The most common honey is clover honey, a relatively sweet and light flavored honey, and that whose flavor is probably what you imagine when you think of honey. You may also come across honeys produced from other flower such as alfalfa, fireweed, blueberry, or others, which have slightly different flavor profiles and sweetness.  
It would be interesting to see how different honeys affect cocktails and I’m quite certain that specific honeys may complement flavors better than others. Using honey as a sweetener in cocktails can add a unique touch, but since it has the propensity to gel up if put directly into a cold cocktail shaker, it is a good idea to make honey syrup. Though some recipes ask for the use of heat to dissolve the honey, unless your honey has crystallized, simply stirring the honey and water together should be sufficient. 

**Colony Collapse Disorder**  
As an insect-lover and amateur entomologist, it is sad that honeybees have been dying in increasing numbers over the last decade due to “Colony Collapse Disorder” (CCD) with beekeepers reporting losses of 25-80% from year to year. CCD is caused by worker bees leaving the hive and not returning, resulting in baby bee larva left uncared for and eventually a dead hive. Honeybees are an essential part of the ecosystem and extremely important to the human food chain. Without honeybees, we would lose a large fraction of our fresh produce, and as key pollinators of the alfalfa used to feed livestock, the price of meat/dairy products would skyrocket. 
A number of theories have been presented attempting to explain the cause of CCD, blaming them on almost anything under the sun. While a lot of research goes into CCD, there is a lot of agricultural lobbying going on that I believe clouds the issue. To me, it seems that honeybees have been successful pollinators for millennia and thrived under human care. Therefore, it seems unlikely that natural hazards such as mites, fungus, pathogens and the bee’s immune system would have changed drastically enough in the last decade to explain the recent die-offs. Urbanization has an effect as less flowers, less food, and less habitat for bees has resulted in a loss of native bee species, but this still does not explain why beekeepers are experiencing CCD since they are taking their hives to farm areas filled with crops.  
I strongly believe that the biggest contributor to CCD is the use of modern pesticides, specifically neonicotinoids, which have been shown to have neurological effects at extremely low doses in bees. This would explain why the bees leave the hive and do not return, as shown most recently in [this 2012 PLoS ONE paper](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0030023). The European Union banned the use of neonicotinoids this year, which will hopefully demonstrate the causative role of this agent in CCD. I simply don’t see how it is unclear that an insecticide could *not* affect honeybees in any way. Unfortunately in the US, the extensive lobbying by big agricultural companies to protect their business interests has clouded the research space on CCD. If anyone is interested in further reading on this topic, I highly recommend the 2008 book *A Spring Without Bees*. 

**Cheers!**  
Apologies for the lengthy sidenote/rant on Colony Collapse Disorder, it is an important but understated issue with serious repercussions. Hopefully you enjoyed the cocktail-related portions of this week’s post and have a chance to drink to the health of honeybees. Even better, go out and help native bees out by planting some bee-friendly flowers in your garden. I believe the next NCotW will be a guest post by /u/GWCad, so look forward to that next week. As usual, your comments, questions, and suggestions are all appreciated and until next time, cheers!
