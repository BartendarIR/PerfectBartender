**Not Cocktail of the Week #94: Savoy Tango**  
Big thanks to /u/ems88 for filling in for me last week while I was out enjoying the food, drink, and culture of New Orleans. His post on Audrey Saunders’ [Earl Grey MarTEAni](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2jbqnq/not_cocktail_of_the_week_93_the_earl_grey/) was incredibly well done and I was very happy to have him contribute to this feature. For this week’s NCotW, I wanted to present one last sloe gin cocktail before moving on from my temporary autumn obsession. The previous cocktails ([Sloe Gin Fizz](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2hcybr/not_cocktail_of_the_week_90_sloe_gin_fizz/) and [Charlie Chaplin](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2iolvl/not_cocktail_of_the_week_92_charlie_chaplin/)) have been sours, but I wanted to share at least one spirit-forward cocktail using sloe gin. Luckily I stumbled across the Savoy Tango courtesy of the Cocktail Chronicles post on the Charlie Chaplin, so I will be sharing that for NCotW this week.  

**Background**  
The Savoy Tango, one of only three cocktails in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* to carry the hotel’s name, originates from that temple of (pre-)Prohibition Era cocktails. Despite its proclaimed popularity at the time, this cocktail seems to have fallen into relative obscurity, possibly lost along the way as the quality of sloe gin declined. With the current cocktail revival, finding a quality sloe gin is much more feasible, so perhaps it is time to revisit some of these dusty recipes.

**Recipes**  
*The Savoy Cocktail Book*, Harry Craddock, 1930  
* ½ Sloe Gin  
* ½ Applejack or Calvados  
Shake well and strain into cocktail glass.  
*This cocktail is a very great favourite at the Savoy Hotel, London, where it was invented.*

**Results**  
This is another cocktail that I think really encapsulates autumn. Its nose is luscious with notes of warm apple, fruity berry, rich stone fruit, and spice. In the mouth the first impression I get is of a lush fruitiness with a mild texture, on the whole coming across as warm and cozy. Focusing a bit more, I first detect the berry and stone fruit notes up front with a mild tartness coming through from the sloe gin. The apple and spice flavors come in the latter half of the experience, accompanied with the slight dry tannic bitterness I’ve come to associate with my sloe gin. Between the 100 proof bonded apple brandy and the 54 proof sloe gin that I use, this is a bit stronger than one would expect compared to a typical stirred drink, but it’s definitely worth sipping and enjoying on a crisp autumn evening.

**Cheers!**  
Apologies for the relatively short post, I’ve been busy between work, travel, and an exciting upcoming project, but hopefully I’ve added one more reason for you to go get yourself some quality sloe. While I’m sure most of you have grown accustomed to this weekly feature showing up, the occasional show of support for this side project of mine is still very welcome. On that note, I came across the recently released Death & Co. book at a bookstore in New Orleans and am currently lusting after that tome. I added it to my lengthy wishlist of cocktail books on Amazon (click [here](http://www.amzn.com/w/LJIN08K4RTJW)) if you’re interested in supporting them by buying their book and encouraging me at the same time by sending me a copy. Otherwise reddit gold is always a welcome small token of support. As usual, your questions and feedback are greatly appreciated, as I love having the little weekly discussion sessions. Cheers!
