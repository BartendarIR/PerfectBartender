Not Cocktail of the Week #87: Queen’s Park Swizzle & 151 Swizzle
Thanks to /u/gregbenson314 for his post last week on the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club, the break halfway through NCotW Tiki Edition let me get a head start on the last two Tiki cocktails. This week’s cocktail was originally going to be the Queen’s Park Swizzle, a simple cocktail which would allow me to revisit Demerara rum after the post on the Bumbo & Rum Manhattan, but after I stumbled across the coveted Lemon Hart 151 overproof Demerara rum, I wanted to make and present the 151 Swizzle as well, so you get a special double feature this week. If you have a nice Demerara rum on hand or have lucked into a bottle of Lemon Hart 151, skip ahead to the appropriate recipe, mix one up, then sit back and enjoy it while reading.

Queen’s Park Swizzle
Background
The Queen’s Park Swizzle claims its origins as an adaptation of the general Caribbean swizzle from the Queen’s Park Hotel in the 1920s. The Queen’s Park Hotel, built in 1893, was a luxurious resort for wealthy Brits vacationing in Trinidad, equipped with all the latest modern amenities including electricity. While the hotel was torn down a decade or so ago, their signature house cocktail cemented its place in history. Trader Vic was particularly enamored of this cocktail, quoted in 1946 as calling it “the most delightful form of anesthesia given out today.” Though the term swizzle as a drink predates the Queen’s Park Swizzle, Martin Cate (owner of Smuggler’s Cove and a very well-respected figure in the modern Tiki revival) considers it to be the ancestral swizzle drink that begat the swizzle family as we know today as it was the first to include the citrus juice now common to all modern swizzles.

This cocktail is ridiculously delicious and incredibly quaffable. I’m already a huge fan of Demerara rum and while making this drink is lot of work, it is another amazing way to showcase it. While I don’t own a proper swizzle stick ($20 for a single one on Cocktail Kingdom is too rich for my blood), I jury-rigged a serviceable alternative using the back of my barspoon and a skewer I cut down to fit my Collins glass. It worked reasonably well, but the skewer didn’t stay as well as I would’ve liked. Perhaps next time I will try to improve it by cutting some slight notches in the skewer for a tighter fight.
I first tasted the version at Smuggler’s Cove finding a very lush vegetal mint nose with the cocktail itself very cold and crisp with mint and sugar being the dominant notes, sour lime keeping the palate fresh, and rum a bit more in the background appearing near the finish. They also finish it with a napkin rolled up and neatly tied around the middle of the drink which works wonders in keeping the condensation from getting out of hand, so if you have the means to do the same, it is a really clever touch.
Recreating it at home where I can better focus on tasting, I found that with the generous amount of crushed ice (but equally generous amount of tasty Demerara rum), the nose from the cocktail itself is relatively muted, carrying only the notes derived from the garnishes, which give it a refreshing mint and a bit of spice from the Angostura bitters dashed atop it. Sipping it is where the magic happens though, with a marvelous balance of sweetness up front, mingling with a mild tart lime note and a very crisp herbal mint body, finishing with the rich smoky sugariness of Demerara rum and a lingering spiced bitter finish. Much like a Mint Julep, the combination of crushed ice and mint give it an invigoratingly cool element and I daresay makes it an equal to that venerated American classic. Give it a try and you may also be inclined to agree. I, for one, agree with Trader Vic’s sentiment that the Queen’s Park Swizzle is a delightful form of anesthesia and found that 3 oz of Demerara rum disappeared frighteningly fast.

151 Swizzle
Background
The 151 Swizzle was published in Beachbum Berry’s Grog Log by Jeff “Beachbum” Berry in 1998. He credits it a bartender at Don the Beachcomber’s in Hollywood named Tony Ramos, who was serving it in the 1960s. I was able to uncover little else about the background of this cocktail, but if anyone knows more, please share.

Recipes
Beachbum Berry Remixed, Jeff Berry, 2010
via Beachbum Berry’s Grog Log, 1998
* 1.5 oz 151-proof Demerara rum (Lemon Hart or El Dorado) [I would argue Lemon Hart is really the only choice]
* 0.5 oz fresh lime juice
* 0.5 oz sugar syrup
* 1 dash Angostura bitters
* 6 drops (1/8 tsp) Pernod
* 8 oz (1 cup) crushed ice
* Fresh nutmeg
Put everything – except nutmeg – in a blender. Blend at high speed for 5 seconds. Pour unstrained into a metal cup with a flared top (pictured) or a pilsner glass, adding more crushed ice to fill. Dust with nutmeg. Garnish with a cinnamon stick.

Stumbling across the venerated Lemon Hart 151 when production of it is currently on hold was very exciting and since I’ve never had an overproof Demerara rum before, I wanted to start myself with some simple cocktails to better understand its unique flavor profile. The 151 Swizzle was the first that came to mind, which was followed shortly after (the next day) with a Kapu Kai, Jeff “Beachbum” Berry’s original version of a classic Daiquiri using Lemon Hart 151. Disclaimer: 1.5 oz of 151-proof rum is nearly twice as strong as an equivalent measure of 80-proof spirit and 40% stronger than a 2.0 oz pour. Imbibe with moderation as Lemon Hart 151 goes down a lot smoother than you would expect and this cocktail does an amazing job of hiding its strength.
The 151 Swizzle, much like the Queen’s Park Swizzle, is topped with a generous amount of crushed ice, which masks most of the rum aroma, compensating with the cinnamon and fresh nutmeg garnishes which give it a pleasantly spicy nose with a faint hint of dark Demerara sugar. Sipping it through the straw, it is very cold and crisp with the strong smoky Demerara sugar note of Lemon Hart on full display in contrast with a tart lime note that persists in the background throughout. Interestingly, my wife described the combination of tart lime and Demerara sugar as reminiscent of dark red cherries. There was a lingering burnt sugar bitterness on the palate, but I found this cocktail to be simple and very refreshing. Hand crushing 8 oz of ice is no small task, but for a drink like this it’s worth it.

Variations
In terms of variations, there are many other swizzles, but the one that jumps to my mind is the 2070 Swizzle, cleverly named for its use of Angostura 1919 and Lemon Hart 151 rum (1919 + 151 = 2070), from Martin Cate, owner of Smuggler’s Cove. Here is an interview with the man himself and a recipe for the 2070 Swizzle if you are interested.

Demerara (and overproof) Rum
Demerara rum is produced in Guyana from sugar cane grown on the banks of the Demerara river. It was the Dutch that introduced sugarcane to Guyana in the 1640s, but the rum produced in Guyana follows the English tradition, who brought their expertise with distillation to the island in the 1650s. By the 1700s, there were over 300 independent sugar estates, each producing their own unique Demerara rum, typically on a pot still. Most notable was the Port Mourant estate, established in 1732, which produced the rum rations for the Dutch Royal Navy on a double wooden pot still. Over time, many of these estates were closed or consolidated, with 180 remaining by the end of the 1800s and just 18 in the 1950s. Today Demerara Distillers Ltd. (DDL) is solely responsible for the production of Demerara rum having slowly consolidated the multitude of distilleries on Guyana during the 20th century. Thankfully they have successfully preserved the history of Demerara rum by moving, maintaining and using many of the old stills for production today, which have resided at the Diamond estate since 1998.
While DDL produces Demerara rum for many different brands, the El Dorado line of rums are their flagship product, each highlighting different unique characteristics imparted by their historic stills. As with all rum, they start with sugarcane, in this case grown near the Demerara river and harvested by hand to this day. The sugarcane is crushed, the resulting juice is boiled, and the syrup is crystallized to produce Demerara sugar and Demerara molasses (photos from the Uitvlugt plant here). The remaining molasses is diluted with 4 parts water and fermented with a proprietary blend of local and commercial yeasts in both closed tanks and open fermentation vats for up to 26 hours. While the starting material and initial steps are already unique to Demerara rum, it is certainly the historic stills at the Diamond estate that make El Dorado Demerara rums such a special product. The first is their wooden continuous Coffey still, similar to the designs patented by Aeneas Coffey in 1832. The particular still they use is the last surviving still from the Enmore sugar estate, which was first established in 1880. Made from local Greenheart wood, this is the only working wooden column still in the world. Second and third are their wooden pot stills, also made from durable Greenheart wood. One is a single wooden pot still from the Versailles estate that is over 150 years old and the other is a double wooden pot still from Port Mourant that is over 250 years old. The last of their historic stills is the French Savalle still, a four column metal still from the Uitvlugt estate made in the 18th century which can be adjusted to produce nine different styles of rum. You can see photos from the Diamond estate and the stills here and here. Finally they have a standard copper Coffey still and a massive modern column still that produces the bulk of the Demerara rum, but they continue to produce rums on the historic stills to this day, using different combinations for their different products. All aged in used whiskey barrels, their 3-year offering is comprised of rums made on the French Savalle still and the copper Coffey still; the 12-year adds rums made from the wooden Coffey still and double wooden pot still; and the 15-year is primarily comprised of rums from both the single and double pot stills.
As DDL is the sole producer of Demerara rum, they are also responsible for making Lemon Hart 151, a unique and irreplaceable rum in Tiki cocktails. Overproof rum is defined as having greater than 50% alcohol by volume, so reaching 151 proof is not a requirement. Other common overproof rums are J. Wray & Nephew, very popular in Jamaica at 123 proof; Smith & Cross, another Jamaican-style rum packed with fruit and funk at 114 proof; Bacardi 151 and Cruzan 151, both neutral Spanish-style rums; El Dorado 151, which is actually closer to the Spanish-style while made with Demerara sugar; and Gosling’s 151, which some at Tiki Central believe it can serve as a suitable alternative to Lemon Hart 151 (more below). Overproof rums can either serve to bolster the alcohol content of a drink, in the case of the Spanish-style overproofs, but can also add strong concentrated flavors to a drink, which is the case for Lemon Hart 151. This particular overproof Demerara rum has intense flavors of burnt sugar, dark molasses and dried fruit. Despite it being essential for Tiki cocktails, availability of Lemon Hart 151 has been spotty throughout the recent Tiki revival. It first went off the shelves in May 2010 when it was sold by Pernod-Ricard to Mosaiq, causing hoarding and rationing amongst the Tiki crowd. It returned in 2011 thanks to the efforts of Ed Hamilton (see him and Martin Cate taste testing old vs new Lemon Hart here), but recently disappeared again in May 2014 as Mosaiq either moves its bottling plant and/or tests the waters for its popularity (see this thread on Tiki Central). Plans are for it to return summer next year, so if you see a bottle of Lemon Hart 151 on the shelf, grab it while you can.
Demerara rum is most often characterized by having a rich smoky sugar flavor and Jeff “Beachbum” Berry recommends either the 80-proof from Lemon Hart or El Dorado. For overproof rum, he specifically calls for Lemon Hart 151 because “El Dorado’s 151 lacks the heavy body and gunpowder richness of Lemon Hart 151”. If available, I recommend the El Dorado 8-year for making cocktails, though I personally am working through a bottle of El Dorado 12-year, which serves both sipping and cocktail purposes.

Cheers!
Whew, another exhaustive post, but one that hopefully does Demerara rum justice. This inaugural run of NCotW Tiki Edition comes to a conclusion next week with a final classic Tiki cocktail that uses three of the five styles of rum covered in this series. As usual, any questions or feedback are welcome in the comments section below. Hopefully I’ve given some of you the confidence to give one of these a try either at your local Tiki cocktail bar or at home. Cheers!
