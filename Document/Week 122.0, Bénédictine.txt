**Not Cocktail of the Week #122: Vieux Ananas**  
I’m back baby! Sorry for the hiatus, I started a job at a new company a little over a year ago and I just got too busy to be regularly writing about cocktails. Lucky for all of you guys, that job ended a few weeks back so here I am, at least for a few months. For those unfamiliar to the NCotW series, I used to write about a cocktail of particular interest to myself, mostly on a weekly basis, trying to cover both classic and modern cocktails with a smattering of simple cocktails for beginners. You can find them all indexed and archived on the /r/cocktails wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/wiki/ncotw). A bit of trivia for those that weren’t here since the beginning, I actually just decided almost three years ago to pick up a very short-lived “Cocktail of the Week” series and just couldn’t stop myself. Educating myself about cocktails and having the opportunity to share it with others was always the goal and has been extremely rewarding. So here’s to new beginnings and more great cocktails! 

**Background**  
This is a modern cocktail, published on the *Imbibe Magazine* website August 28, 2015. There’s really not much to say about its history other than it was created by [Ezra Star](http://www.drinkfortpoint.com/ezra-star), general manager at Drink in Boston’s Fort Point neighborhood, which won the Tales of the Cocktail Spirited Award for World’s Best Cocktail Bar in 2013. I personally stumbled across this drink in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/4g7tks/plantation_pineapple_rum_has_finally_arrived_in/) reddit thread from April 2016, suggested by /u/beardedjerk in response to a request for recipes using Plantation pineapple rum. If you haven’t had the opportunity to get a bottle of this, I think between this and the [Pineapple Daiquiri](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/wiki/ncotw/pineapple_daiquiri), you’re really doing yourself a disservice if you don’t.  

**Recipes**  
via [*Imbibe Magazine*](http://imbibemagazine.com/vieux-ananas/)  
via Ezra Star, Drink, Boston  
* 1 oz rye whiskey  
* 1 oz Plantation pineapple rum  
* 1 oz sweet vermouth  
* 0.5 oz Benedictine  
* 1 dash Angostura bitters  
Stir ingredients together in a mixing glass with ice. Strain over a large ice cube into a double Old Fashioned glass. Garnish with an orange twist.  

**Results**  
I tried a couple versions of this cocktail using different rye whiskies and sweet vermouths. The first was with my usual standbys of Rittenhouse rye and Carpano Antica sweet vermouth. This version of the Vieux Ananas had a very pleasant aroma of tropical fruit, pineapple rind in particular, and warm spiced citrus like clove studded oranges. On the palate it started with a hit of orange aromatics, transitioned to a combination of flavors that reminded me of a baked spice cake, and finished with sweet pineapple and caramel notes. This version reminded me of a pineapple upside-down cake with its rich, sweet, fruity, and spicy flavor notes. This is a decadent cocktail well-suited for enjoying in the wintery months with a tropical reminder of warmer days to come.  
I also tried a different version with Old Overholt rye and Miro Rojo sweet vermouth. The Miro Rojo is a Spanish vermouth that I recently picked up to fill the spot that Dolin Rouge usually resides in, as I find it to be a slightly heavier bodied and richer version of the fruit-forward Dolin Rouge. I thought that this combination of ingredients would accentuate the fruit character of this drink by using a less spicy rye and a fruitier vermouth. Unusually, I found that the pineapple note in the nose was dampened, instead finding a more orange and herbal vermouth aroma. Similarly this cocktail started with an aromatic citrus note on the palate, but overall had much lighter flavor and body. The heart of the drink seemed a bit more malty and I found it relatively brief and crisp before finishing with a mild sweet pineapple finish. This version was quite drinkable and less dessert-y without the rich sweet vanilla notes of Carpano Antica.  

**Cheers!**  
Well, there it is, a new entry for NCotW, I finally broke down and did it. Hope you have a chance to enjoy this cocktail, I feel like it’s made a couple rounds around here, but I love it so much that I wanted to give more people a chance to try it. If you do make one, or have made one already, I’d love to hear what you think about it, maybe your own tasting notes or tweaks.   
Since I have a lot more free time these days (and became a mod), I’ve been trying to spend more time making content for /r/cocktails by adding things to the wiki like the [starter’s guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/wiki/starting_guide) and starting new (and hopefully regular) features like AMAs, of which the [first was held yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/59x2b4/cocktails_ama_1_cocktail_virgin_slut_bartender/) by /u/cocktailvirgin. Feel free to drop me a line if you have any other feedback or suggestions about the subreddit. Cheers!
