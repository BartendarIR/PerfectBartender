**Not Cocktail of the Week #70: Singapore Sling**  
I must admit that I’ve convinced myself that I’ve been putting this off for a while because I couldn’t stomach paying $1.00 for a decent lime, but looking back, there actually hasn’t been a NCotW using lime juice since #40 where /u/bitcheslovebanjos posted an extensive write-up on the [Zombie](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1o2ybi/not_cocktail_of_the_week_40_the_zombie/). In light of this notable deficit of cocktails using lime and the imminent onset of the warmer weather of summer, prepare yourself (and your wallet) for more cocktails using limes. Luckily the price seems to be dropping back down, maybe 2/$1, which is a bit more tolerable. This week, inspired by my “recent” visit to Singapore (New Year’s is still recent right?), I want to share the Singapore Sling, a delicious classic that combines many of the ingredients I’ve been working with recently and have hopefully found their way into your cabinets as well.

**Background**  
The Singapore Sling has a storied history that starts with its original inception at the Long Bar at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore somewhere between 1910 and 1915. This concoction is credited to Ngiam Tong Boon and while popular and well known today, seems to have gone through a period of obsolescence in the 1930s during which the original recipe was lost. The result of this is readily apparent in the many varied recipes that one can dig up through history. This was frustrating enough that David Embury, author of *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks* commented “Of all the recipes published for this drink, I have never seen any two that were alike.” The current incarnation of the Singapore Sling is reportedly cobbled together from notes and memories of old bartenders by Ngiam Tong Boon’s nephew in the 1970s and is now the standard expectation when ordering a Singapore Sling. While the original Long Bar has since been lost, the Singapore Sling is still served at the Raffles Hotel, though I must admit I had very little interest in paying over $20 for their premixed and blended version (cocktails in Singapore are extremely expensive and touristy things even more so). I figured I could probably do a better version myself when I got home anyways. You may not get the ambience and historical setting (though the original Long Bar no longer exists), but you do gain the ability to experiment, learn, and save your wallet.
