**Not Cocktail of the Week #46: Scofflaw**  
The Scofflaw was one of the first cocktails I have a clear recollection of making. It was the first cocktail that I made grenadine for and I ultimately ended up making *way* too much. You can read a bit more about making grenadine and a bit of my previous experience with it in my post on the [Jack Rose](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1bnysd/not_cocktail_of_the_week_13_jack_rose/). I thought I would share the Scofflaw with you all this week as it is a delicious cocktail that I go back to almost every time I make some new grenadine and is another cocktail that seems well-suited for the autumn, though it can also work year-round.

**Background**  
The Scofflaw cocktail hails from the era of Prohibition when many of the great American bartenders pulled up their stakes, moving to Europe to ply their trade. Unlike many of its brethren, the Scofflaw has clear origins, attributed to a bartender known as “Jock”, who worked at Harry’s New York Bar in Paris. Though the word Scofflaw is well-established in the English vernacular as someone who literally scoffs at the law, this term was actually coined during Prohibition and in an intentional ironic twist, became the name of a cocktail. A certain Anti-Saloon league member known as Delcevare King held a contest announced in the *Boston Herald* late in 1923 asking for a term to describe “a lawless drinker of illegally made or illegally obtained liquor”. He wanted to shame those who continued to imbibe alcohol 4 years after the enactment of Prohibition and two people, Pastor Henry Irving Dale and Kate L. Butler, both came up with the term scofflaw independently, and were announced as the winners of the contest on January 23, 1924, splitting the prize of $200. Less than two weeks later, the *Chicago Tribune* reported that “Jock, the genial bartender of Harry’s New York Bar, yesterday invented the Scoff-law Cocktail, and it has already become exceedingly popular among American prohibition dodgers.” In 1927, it was recorded in Harry McElhone’s *Barflies & Cocktails* and was also included in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* in 1930. According to Ted Haigh, the original recipes call for the use of Canadian whiskey because that was the only product available in the United States during Prohibition. With better quality spirits much more available today, using a good quality rye whiskey is definitely the way to go.  

**Recipes**

**Results**  
*the lively scofflaw*  
*playfully light on his feet*  
*juicy fruit and spice*  
I always find the Scofflaw to be a dangerously quaffable cocktail. The nose is crisp and lemony, which gives way to a refreshingly light but full-textured cocktail in the mouth. I first get the pleasant notes from the vermouth, which transition to the interplay between sweet fruitiness of grenadine and the tartness of lemon. The drink is carried by the spicy backbone of rye and finishes in a way that ultimately results in my draining my glass much too quickly.  
Again, if you need recipes for grenadine, check out my previous post on the [Jack Rose](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1bnysd/not_cocktail_of_the_week_13_jack_rose/). It is super easy, leagues better than your generic Rose’s grenadine, and way cheaper than high-quality stuff like Small Hand Foods. I add a few drops of orange flower water to give it a bit of depth and it’s great to be able to whip some up fresh as needed. 

**Variations**  
There is a bit of variation possible within the Scofflaw, some elect to use bourbon whiskey while Gary Regan suggests a much drier and spirit-forward version of the Scofflaw in *The Joy of Mixology*, both of which I have not tried because I am just so fond of the version I am accustomed to from Ted Haigh. If you find it too sweet, perhaps Gary Regan’s version will suit your palate better. Give them a try and feel free to let me know how you found it in the comments.  

**Cheers!**  
A relatively brief post this week, hopefully I will be gearing up for some more holiday oriented cocktails for the next few weeks. Having family over for Thanksgiving is always exciting and a great opportunity to make a few special things to entertain. As always, your questions, comments, suggestions and feedback are appreciated below. Thanks for reading and cheers!
