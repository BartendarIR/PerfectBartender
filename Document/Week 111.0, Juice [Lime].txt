**Not Cocktail of the Week #111: The Rickey**

The Rickey cocktail may not be the most complex or exciting recipe but its history is cemented deeply in local politics, lobbying, and gambling rooted directly within the power corridors of Washington D.C.

**Background**

 “Colonel” Joseph K. Rickey, who served as a soldier in the Civil War, began a successful post-war career as a Washington lobbyist in the early 1880’s. A devout Democrat, he successfully campaigned for President Grover Cleveland  in 1884 and 1892. He excelled in guiding the destinies of legislature through eating, drinking, laughing, and gambling with the Nation’s most powerful politicians.

During his time in the Nation’s Capital, he often frequented a dingy hole in the wall bar known as Shoomaker’s Saloon, located a few doors from the National Theater on Pennsylvania Avenue. It was where senators, congressmen, Supreme Court justices, cabinet members, generals, newsmen, and other Washington power brokers frequented regularly. Joe Rickey eventually purchased Shoomaker’s Saloon when it came up for sale in 1883.

There are two common versions as to the origin of the Rickey Cocktail. The first has it that Rickey himself first conceived his signature drink during a typically hot, DC summer day.  The Shoomaker’s bartender, George Williamson, prepared it to the Colonel’s instructions, as a whiskey cocktail made with Shoomaker’s own house brand whiskey. 

George Rothwell Brown, author of “Washington: A Not Too Serious History,” 1930, suggested instead that an unknown stranger discussed with Williamson how drinks were prepared in the Caribbean with half of a lime. He provided Williamson some limes and asked him to substitute rye whiskey for rum. The following morning Williamson was said to have made one for Col. Rickey who then adopted it as his signature drink. 
Nearly a decade later, gin would eclipse rye as the preferred liquor for the cocktail which then spawned a myriad of cocktails known as “Rickeys”. 

Col. Rickey was not a fan of this evolution having been quoted “The drink named after me was always made by the experts in Shoomaker’s from limes thereafter, and soon became popular. Washington during a session of Congress, is filled with people from all parts of the country....Only in New York was it perverted and made a thing of shame. Here they make it with gin, which is a liquor no gentleman could ever bring himself to drink.”

Even so, in 1899, Col. Rickey was granted trademark rights for the name Rickey on both whiskey and gin. 
The DC Craft Bartenders Guild, an independent guild of bartenders in the District, designated July as Rickey Month and has since held annual competitions to celebrate the District's native cocktail by inviting local bartenders to compete. In 2011, the Rickey was declared the District's official native cocktail, and the month of July was declared Rickey Month in DC.

* Club Soda

In a medium size fizz glass add 1 or 2 pieces of ice, squeeze lime and combine with gin. Fill glass with club soda, carbonic, or seltzer, and serve with a spoon.

**Results**

I tested the original bourbon version first. I prefer using a rye based bourbon for this cocktail vs a wheat based bourbon like Markers or Weller because I think the softer flavors don’t compliment the tartness of the lime and crispness of the club soda quite as well. The combination of bourbon and lime is actually a nice transition from winter into spring. The oak, maple, and baking spice flavors in the bourbon and sourness in the lime come through fairly strong early but fade and balance out as the ice dilutes.  

Next I tried a Gin Rickey using DC’s own Green Hat. They recently released a Navy Strength offering that is wonderful. The juniper profile is really strong with this gin and shines nicely in this cocktail. There is a slight ginger element as well. The high proof of the Navy Strength comes through with a good punch. Gin and citrus just work for me, especially with this gin. Since this cocktail is so simple and straightforward, you will get different results just by interchanging the gin. 

I’ve had quite a few Rickey’s in my day living in DC. Drinking these in early Spring with temperature in the low 50s isn’t quite as refreshing as I remember. But on a scorching hot summer day a Rickey is a simple, classic cocktail worth giving a try.
