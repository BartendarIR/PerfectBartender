**Not Cocktail of the Week #104: Vintage Manhattan & Vintage Negroni**  
Today marks the two-year anniversary of NCotW! Hooray! This year certainly has gone by in a blur, it certainly doesn’t feel like a year since my post on the [Old-Fashioned](http://redd.it/1u7nb3/), but over this last year I’ve had the opportunity to add yellow Chartreuse ([Widow's Kiss](http://redd.it/1toslc/), [Alaska](http://redd.it/1vb2os/), [Champs Elysees](http://redd.it/209moq/)), Cherry Heering ([Blood and Sand](http://redd.it/1yds2e/), [Remember the Maine](http://redd.it/20u5cf/), [Singapore Sling](http://redd.it/24z689/)), sloe gin ([Sloe Gin Fizz](http://redd.it/2hcybr/), [Charlie Chaplin](http://redd.it/2iolvl/), [Savoy Tango](http://redd.it/2k0ksp/)), and Averna ([Flannel Shirt](http://redd.it/2m3rsx/), [Black Manhattan](http://redd.it/2o6vuo/)) to my bar, as well as a significant number of rums for that 6-week exploration of Tiki drinks ([Three Dots & A Dash](http://redd.it/2ct529/), [Hotel Nacional Special](http://redd.it/2dgqc3/), [Jungle Bird](http://redd.it/2e3p09/), [Royal Bermuda Yacht Club](http://redd.it/2ergog/), [Queen's Park Swizzle & 151 Swizzle](http://redd.it/2fdo9o/), [Navy Grog](http://redd.it/2g11qr/)). I also tried to fund the NCotW book through redditmade, but though that ultimately fell short I plan to try again and hopefully offer it in time for Christmas next year.  
Between pursuing and developing other projects, I will admit it has been challenging to keep up with preparing one of these write-ups every week and I feel that I’ve reached a saturation point with the audience here, so this coming year I plan to finally take advantage of the name “*Not* Cocktail of the Week” and no longer commit myself to writing these every week. They may still come on a weekly basis when I have the time and inspiration, but at the very least I promise one every other week. This will give me more time to try new things and find cocktails that I love enough to write about. Ultimately this is only a hobby and it needs to be balanced with the rest of my life. Thanks for all the support, I hope you all will understand. 
Getting to this week’s actual content, I wanted to commemorate this occasion by writing about the Vintage Manhattan, a cocktail I prepared six months ago after reading about it and the bottle-aging technique from Tony Conigliaro. I also applied the identical process to the Negroni as an experiment, which I will share about further below.  

**Background**  
The Vintage Manhattan comes from Tony Conigliaro’s 2012 book *The Cocktail Lab*. It is a beautiful book that details the thought process behind some of the drinks he’s known for at 69 Colebrooke Row, a world class cocktail bar in London. Filled with inventive aroma/flavor combinations and unique techniques drawn from modern cuisine, it demonstrates what cocktails can aspire to achieve given unlimited resources and imagination. While most of the cocktails found within are out of reach for the home enthusiast and the vast majority of cocktail bars, the early chapters do have cocktails that are feasible for most.  
One that caught my attention when reading through this book was the Vintage Manhattan. Though many people have become familiar and tried their own hand at barrel-aging cocktails over the past few years, partially thanks to [Jeffrey Morgenthaler popularizing it on his website](http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2010/barrel-aged-cocktails/) a few years ago, it has remained something firmly out of reach for me. It was infeasible for me to invest both the large amount of alcohol and future time commitment to drinking it while maintaining NCotW on a weekly basis. However, the Vintage Manhattan called for bottle aging, something that I could easily replicate and, as an added bonus, on a small scale. Curiously, Jeffrey Morgenthaler references this technique when he introduces barrel-aged cocktails, yet few seem to have noticed or tried it, and this approach has not really taken off.  
Tony Conigliaro was inspired to bottle-age cocktails after he tasted a bottle of Dubonnet from the 1920s and was amazed at how good it tasted, with the residual air in the bottle maturing and mellowing the flavors. He credits further inspiration from a piece on wine oxidation from the famed kitchen scientist/writer Harold McGee. He was curious what would happen to the fortified wine component of cocktails over time and limited interaction with air in a similar fashion. Choosing the classic and straightforward Manhattan as a vehicle, he ran some small scale experiments finding the results intriguing after just one year of aging. After these promising initial experiments, he made 48 (!) bottles of 2:1 Manhattan with “0.29 of Angostura bitters” (not 100% sure how this should translate, see my confusion in the recipe). He stored them in empty sterilized bottles with a one inch gap of air, sealed with electrical tape and kept in a cellar to protect from light and temperature fluctuation.   
In a fresh Manhattan, he describes a “distinct line where the vermouth begins and the bourbon ends”, whereas in the 1-year aged Manhattan, “this line dissipates, the flavors collapse in on themselves, and the drink becomes unpredictable, with a lengthy flavor that reverberates until the last sip.” He’s since then opened a bottle on a yearly basis finding that the flavors continue to evolve with time finding the “…vermouth feels richer, the bourbon heavier…an elegant and decadent cocktail with a powerful aroma...” He finally describes his most recent vintage at time of publication, a 6-year aged Manhattan, as having “an incredible long finish, enormous body, and a gentle hue like a vintage tawny port…a Manhattan with the volume turned all the way up!” With that sort of description, how could I not seek to experience this myself at home?

**Recipes**  
*The Cocktail Lab*, Tony Conigliaro, 2012  
Sweet Manhattan  
* 40 ml (1.3 oz) bourbon  
* 20 ml (0.6 oz) sweet vermouth  
* 2.5 ml (0.5 tsp) maraschino [liqueur or juice?]  
* 3 dashes Angostura bitters  
* Marasca cherry, to garnish  
Combine all the ingredients except the cherry in a cocktail tin over cubed ice. Stir and then strain into a small, chilled coupette. Garnish with a Marasca cherry.  

Vintage Manhattan Mix  
* 450 ml (15 oz) rye whiskey  
* 225 ml (7.5 oz) sweet vermouth  
* 200 ul Angostura bitters [this seems like a miniscule amount, but 200 ml similarly makes no sense]  
Single Serving  
* 50 ml (1.75 oz) Vintage Manhattan Mix

* Marasca cherry, to garnish  
Combine the Vintage Manhattan Mix and maraschino in a cocktail tin and stir over cubed ice. Strain and pour into a small, chilled coupette. Garnish with a Marasca cherry.

**Results**  
After reading *Liquid Intelligence*, I’ve taken to occasionally measuring the final temperature of my cocktails with a Thermapen, which was particularly important in this case as I wanted to conduct the best comparison possible between fresh Manhattan vs bottle-aged Vintage Manhattan. These were both stirred and served at 33°F, a bit warmer than Dave Arnold’s preference, but what I achieve with my typical stir. The Manhattan prepared fresh was a familiar friend with loads of spice from the Angostura and Rittenhouse rye whiskey in the nose. It started in the mouth with the Angostura spices coming through first, followed by the baking spices from rye whiskey, transitioning to the fruity herbal notes of vermouth, and finishing with bitter herbs and Angostura. The Vintage Manhattan aged 6-months (I have another batch prepared for aging 1-year and hopefully more if worthwhile) was significantly and surprisingly different. I’m not sure I agree with Tony Conigliaro yet, but mine have sat for a much shorter period of time. My Vintage Manhattan had much less spice in the nose, replaced instead with more herbal notes from the vermouth. It was more delicate and less assertive than the fresh Manhattan. The overall texture did not seem heavier or richer to me, instead I felt it was softer and thinner at this stage. Flavor-wise, much like in the nose, the Angostura note up front is much lessened and, in agreement with Tony Conigliaro’s description, I found it much more difficult to pick out the individual contributions of the rye whiskey and sweet vermouth, which melded together much more than I expected. I did found the finish much longer with an accentuated bitterness, which was also in agreement with Tony Conigliaro, but I also detected a bit of an oxidized vermouth note near the finish. I’m definitely curious to see what this will taste like another 6 months from now and I will have to consider preparing a larger batch for the next round.
