**Not Cocktail of the Week #59: Blood and Sand**  
Thanks to /u/GWCad for volunteering a great cocktail last week for the Valentine’s Day edition of NCotW. I made myself a [Between the Sheets](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1xqbox/not_cocktail_of_the_week_58_between_the_sheets/) last week, finding its sweet fruitiness quite enjoyable and especially well-suited for the woman looking for a cute, but classic, cocktail. For this week’s NCotW, I wanted to share the Blood and Sand cocktail which features orange juice, as well as a recent addition to my cabinet, Cherry Heering.  

**Background**  
The Blood and Sand cocktail is said to be named after the 1922 movie about bullfighting and love, [“Blood and Sand”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_and_Sand_(1922_film)), with its deep red color an obvious reference to the “blood” in the title. While I’ve never heard of or seen this classic film, its tale of love and betrayal based on the 1908 book by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez seems to be timeless. It was first filmed and directed by the author himself in 1917, with the most famous version starring Rudolph Valentino in 1922, followed later by a remake starring Tyrone Powers in 1941, and most recently remade in 1989 starring Sharon Stone. As for the cocktail itself, it unfortunately seems to have no individual credited with creating this cocktail, but regardless it is a classic cocktail utilizing Scotch worth enjoying even today.

**Results**  
With the extra time I had thanks to /u/GWCad filling in last week, I was able to go through and test a number of different recipes on the Blood and Sand. I first started with the standard version that is seen in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* as well as many of the more modern texts. For this Blood and Sand, I used cara cara orange juice and Dolin vermouth, finding it to be a very fruit-forward cocktail. It starts with a clear fruity aroma dominated by cherry with a bit of vanilla and citrus with a pleasantly smooth and full textured mouthfeel. Some may find it on the edge of being overly sweet, held in check only by a mild bitter edge. Ultimately with this version I was left asking myself where the Scotch whisky had gone, as I only got a hint of it at the end.  
I then went on to trying the unique version found in *The PDT Cocktail Book*, which significantly increases the fraction of Scotch from 25% to ~45%. In this version, I felt the nose was a more balanced combination of cherry fruit and scotch with a hint of vanilla. Texturally, I felt this version was still very similar to the classic version, but flavor-wise it is no longer dominated by cherry, instead having a progression of flavors starting with sweet cherry and citrus, transforming clearly into the flavor profile of Scotch halfway through, and finishing with the dark fruit and bitter notes of Carpano Antica sweet vermouth. I appreciated that the unique smoky character of Scotch was allowed to peek through in this version and felt this made it more complex and personally more enjoyable. That said, I wasn’t entirely convinced that the bitter complexity of Carpano Antica was essential, so I tried a lighter version substituting Dolin Rouge and adding a flamed orange peel for its complementary caramel and citrus notes. This resulted in a surprisingly similar cocktail, though a bit lighter and more fruit-forward. Without the unique bitter profile of Carpano Antica, the Scotch is able to assert itself more in the finish of the drink.  
After visiting Bourbon and Branch and hanging out with /u/AlmightyJ again, he offered me Bourbon and Branch’s version of the Blood and Sand, which I was able to replicate at home precisely with some Bank Note Scotch whisky, Carpano Antica sweet vermouth, navel orange juice, and a garnished with a flamed orange peel. I felt this version was light, sweet, and refreshing, potentially very well-suited for easy daytime drinking. With the substantial contribution of Cherry Heering, this version, which adheres closely to the classic recipe, starts off with a sweet cherry flavor and a brief note of citrus, with the smokiness of the Scotch whisky and a slight complex bitterness from the Carpano Antica coming through on the tail end. Ultimately, I feel this cocktail definitely requires a deft hand with the Cherry Heering, perhaps a scant pour of it would be better suited as its sweetness can easily overwhelm this cocktail.  
Finally, I did a couple simple experiments on my own using a 3:1:1:1 and 2:1:1:1 ratio of Scotch:orange juice:Cherry Heering:sweet vermouth. For the 3:1:1:1 version, I used the more assertive Carpano Antica for sweet vermouth, ultimately finding this ratio disappointing as at 50% Scotch whisky, this version loses its unique citrus and cherry profile, becoming unbalanced and dominated by Scotch. For a final experiment, the 2:1:1:1 ratio using Dolin Rouge was relatively more enjoyable, maintaining a nice balance between the cherry, orange, and vermouth up front, transitioning to the Scotch whisky on the finish. This version was able to retain its refreshing nature, while still being balanced and allowing the Scotch character to come through.  
TL;DR: The classic formula is enjoyable and refreshing but may be too sweet for the modern palate, perhaps better suited for brunch. The PDT spec is well-thought out and reflects the modern palate while still paying respect to the original flavors of this drink.  

**Variations**  
As a subscriber to Gary ‘gaz’ Regan’s email newsletter, I place a lot of faith in his cocktail suggestions and while I had considered featuring this in the future as its own NCotW, given its obvious similarity to its predecessor, I felt it would be better suited as a variation on the Blood and Sand. Gary ‘gaz’ Regan features cocktails that he deems suitable as one of the “101 Best New Cocktails” on a weekly basis and the [Bloody Nail cocktail]( http://www.gazregan.com/2013/12/101-best-new-cocktails/101-best-new-cocktails-bloody-nail-by-zachary-nelson-the-continental-room-fullerton-ca/) from Zachary Nelson of the Continental Room was one he found worthy. Taking its inspiration from two cocktails, the Blood and Sand and the Rusty Nail, he successfully melds these two classic Scotch cocktails into a unique experience. The Bloody Nail starts with a nose of caramel, citrus, vanilla, and a hint of smoke. Flavor-wise it is still primarily identifiable as a Rusty Nail on my palate as its first flavor is of Drambuie, with the cherry fruit coming through in the middle, and a finish of Scotch. While the balance between Drambuie and Cherry Heering is delicate, it’s definitely worth a try if you have both liqueurs in your cabinet.  
* 2 oz Dewar’s White Label Scotch  
* 0.5 oz Drambuie  
* Scant 0.5 oz Cherry Heering  
* 2 dashes Regan’s Orange Bitters No. 6  
Stir over ice, strain, and garnish with a flamed orange peel

**Cheers!**  
Thanks for continuing to read and support NCotW, it’s very rewarding for me to see how many people it’s able to reach and influence. Hopefully you’ll have a chance to give this classic cocktail a chance, whether at your local cocktail bar or in the comfort of your own home. I look forward to your feedback and suggestions in the comments below, or perhaps a short bit on how you enjoy a Blood and Sand. While this remains a passion project of mine, it does take a fair bit of time (and a minor toll on my liver), so if you’ve been enjoying this series and want to contribute to its continuation, consider the modest donation of some reddit gold which helps me keep on top of comments, or one of the cocktail books on my Amazon wishlist [here](http://amzn.com/w/LJIN08K4RTJW) for furthering my education and research. Regardless, you will all still have NCotW to look forward to next week, it is time to feature a delicious modern cocktail, so until then, cheers!
