**Not Cocktail of the Week #56: Ward Eight**  
While a guest post was originally planned this week, I am happy and proud to be sharing the Ward Eight cocktail with everyone reading this column on /r/cocktails. I’ve definitely underappreciated orange juice in cocktails and with great citrus in season, I feel it I am overdue on giving it its due. 

**Background**  
Compared to many other classic cocktails, the origin story of the Ward Eight cocktail is relatively uncluttered and has mostly converged onto a specific person, time, place, and event. The Ward Eight cocktail is believed to have been concocted to celebrate the imminent election of Martin M. Lomasney, the “Boston Mahatma”, or more fittingly the “Czar of Ward Eight”, to the General Court of Massachusetts in 1898. Ironically, while Mr. Lomasney was a staunch prohibitionist, his friends in the Hendrick’s Club had gathered at the Locke-Ober Café in Boston the night before the election to prematurely celebrate his impending victory. They asked Tim Hussion, their bartender friend who had recently joined Locke-Ober, to concoct something to recognize the contribution of the Eighth Ward of Boston, which historically had given Mr. Lomasney the winning margin in prior elections. While it seems unusual to have a victory party before the election was even held, it seems that Mr. Lomasney was not always walking on the straight and narrow, and thus his friends were quite confident of his victory. He had been quoted in the past saying, “Just before the election we send out suggestions to the voters. We don’t tell ‘em how to vote. We just suggest.” Additionally, he had been known to hand out ballots with his name pre-marked to approaching voters, instructing them to vote with that ballot and bring back a blank one which he would mark and hand to the next person. In any case, the Ward Eight cocktail was then created and has persisted as Boston’s notable contribution to the cocktail world.  
While a memorable and well-accepted story, David Wondrich questions the storied historical origins of the Ward Eight due to its inclusion of grenadine, which did not become popular as a cocktail ingredient until the 1910s. He instead dug up an interesting recipe contributed in 1934 to G. Selmer Fougner, the first regular wine critic who penned the daily column “Along the Wine Trail” in the *New York Sun*. In it, an unnamed contributor states, “The basis of a ‘Ward 8’ was a whisky sour, the idea being to eliminate certain objectionable features of that drink. The Ward 8 was distinctly a warm weather drink, and should be so considered. It was always served in a large, heavy glass of the type generally used for beer – that is with a large round bowl.” While no story as to its origin is included, he does append a very detailed description as to the construction of this version of a Ward Eight, which is quoted below:  
>Juice of one lemon, one barspoon of powdered sugar, a large whisky glass three-quarters full of Bourbon (dissolve the sugar in the juice and whisky), place a rather large piece of ice, in the glass, pour in glass, add three or four dashes of orange bitters, three dashes of crème de menthe, one-half jigger grenadine, fill glass with either plain water or seltzer, add two half slices orange, piece of pineapple and one or two cherries.  
When fresh mint is available the crème de menthe is omitted, and a slightly bruised sprig of mint is added with the slices of orange, &c. This is an improvement. 
Many prefer the juice of half and orange instead of the orange bitters.  
The amount of sugar should be regulated to taste, and likewise the grenadine. The important factors are good liquor and care in mixing. Properly made, the drink is very pleasant, although highly potent.
