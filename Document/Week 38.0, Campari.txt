**Not Cocktail of the Week #38: Lucien Gaudin**  
Despite my love for Campari, I haven’t shared any cocktails with Campari for the last few months, so I guess I am overdue. This week I want to share an interesting cocktail I discovered through [this](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/08/forgotten-classic-cocktails-you-should-know-drink-recipes.html) Serious Drinks article, as it was one of the few that I hadn’t yet encountered. It’s a classic cocktail and a great alternative to a perennial favorite of mine, the [Negroni](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1aoe1c/not_cocktail_of_the_week_11_negroni/).

**Background**  
The Lucien Gaudin cocktail, named after the famed French fencer, is a classic cocktail unearthed by Ted Haigh in his 2009 book, *Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails*. However, as far as I can ascertain, Mr. Haigh did not include an original reference to this cocktail, so its specific origins remain unknown (thanks for confirming /u/yellowed). Regardless, the man this cocktail is named for was a French fencer, who had a very successful run in the 1924 and 1928 Olympic games, winning two gold individual medals, two gold team medals, and two silver team medals, making him one of the best-performing French Olympians. He tragically committed suicide a short time later in 1934, with some speculating that it was due to a thumb injury he suffered in a sparring match that would keep him from the sport, though others claim it was due to the financial difficulties while working as a banker. Either way, as one of the world’s best swordsman, he was immortalized in a classic Prohibition-era cocktail named after him, which is much more than many can claim.

**Results**  
I’m not exactly sure where my wires got crossed, but I ended up using a lemon twist in the last couple Lucien Gaudin cocktails I made, which while pleasant, probably affected the final product, so keep that in mind with these tasting notes. This cocktail immediately reminds me of a Negroni crossed with a Martini as it combines the flavors of gin with both Campari and dry vermouth, respectively. I elected to use a new gin that I recently acquired, Organic Nation, which I read about in the spirits blog of David Driscoll, the purchaser for K&L Wines [here](http://spiritsjournal.klwines.com/klwinescom-spirits-blog/2013/7/6/a-few-things.html). It has a very crisp profile with strong, while not overwhelming, juniper and clean citrus notes.  
My Lucien Gaudin, as seen in the photos, had a strong and forward lemon nose, due to a very juicy piece of lemon peel. Upon sipping, I first taste the sweet orange flavor of Cointreau which combines with lemon oil. There is a slight pause where the subtle herbal notes of dry vermouth are hinted at, but that immediately turns full blast into the strong juniper, botanical and bitter flavors of gin and Campari. In the mouth this is a pretty full-textured cocktail, probably due to the addition of Cointreau, which also helps round out and balance the flavors. The finish is surprisingly bitter, as I suppose the dry vermouth and Cointreau can only go so far to taming Campari. This is a great pre-dinner cocktail with its clean, crisp and bracingly bitter flavor profile.  

**Variations**  
I may try to do a version of this with some genever, which would probably bring this cocktail closer to an Old Pal (rye whiskey, dry vermouth, Campari). That might actually stand up better to the lemon peel and would potentially be another interesting cocktail utilizing genever.  

**Cheers!**  
If you’re a fan of the Negroni, you owe it to yourself to give the Lucien Gaudin a try. It’s a great variation on the familiar flavor profile and can make for a nice change of pace. I definitely need to redo this properly with orange peel instead, I still can’t figure out where I got confused but oh well. If you have any feedback, questions or your own notes on this cocktail, I’d love to hear it in the comments. Hopefully you’re all still enjoying this regular column and until next week, cheers!
