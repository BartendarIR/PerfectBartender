**Not Cocktail of the Week #95: Royal Smile**  
Anyone still craving a normal NCotW post this Wednesday? I first encountered the Royal Smile at my neighborhood cocktail bar, The Alembic, and while I’ve previously written up the closely related [Jack Rose](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1bnysd/not_cocktail_of_the_week_13_jack_rose/) in an old NCotW post, I wanted to revisit that flavor profile this autumn. While I didn’t expect to be posting about this the same day as I announce the NCotW book, its name is conveniently appropriate.  

**Background**  
The Royal Smile seems very similar to the classic Jack Rose, but with its apple brandy component lengthened with gin. In *Imbibe*, David Wondrich believes the Royal Smile to be a Jack Rose renamed when the notorious gangster that shared his name turned state’s evidence and become wildly unpopular. In fact, an article from the December 23, 1912 issue of the Washington Post quotes from a “conversation” between two bartenders:  

>“Call it?” he answered, pausing for a rich name. “Call it a Royal Smile. That’s about as different as anything that I can think of, for Jack Rose’s smile only could be called royal now from the feeble attempt there is to be appear happy.”  

Interestingly, this first mention of the Royal Smile also includes a recipe that differs significantly from most of the recipes I came across, calling for “…one jigger of gin, one jigger of applejack, half a jigger of grenadine and half a jigger of lemon juice…” making it quite different from the original Jack Rose after all. 

**Recipes**  
*The Savoy Cocktail Book*, Harry Craddock, 1930  
* The Juice of ¼ Lemon  
* ¼ Grenadine  
* ½ Applejack or Calvados  
* ¼ Dry Gin  
Shake well and strain into cocktail glass.

*The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*, David Embury, 1948  
* 1 part Grenadine  
* 2 parts Lemon Juice  
* 4 parts Gin  
* 4 parts Apple Brandy  
Shake with cracked ice. The relative proportions of gin and applejack can be varied to suit the individual taste. Some recipes call for the addition of 1 egg white to each 2 drinks.  

*Bartender’s Choice* [app](http://bartenderschoiceapp.com/wordpress/), created by Sam Ross and the bartenders at Milk + Honey in NYC, 2012  
* 1 oz gin  
* 0.75 oz applejack  
* 0.75 oz lime

**Results**  
I first tried a recipe along the lines of the one from *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, using 1 oz of apple brandy (Laird’s Bonded), 0.5 oz gin (Tanqueray Malacca), 0.5 oz fresh lemon juice and 0.5 oz homemade grenadine. I chose to use Tanqueray Malacca in this case as I wanted some spice to accentuate the apple flavor while adding a bit of subtle complexity. I really enjoyed this version as it was bright and tart, capturing an aspect of a fresh apple. The nose was primarily of apple and citrus, from lemon and orange flower water, along with a hint of spice. In the mouth it was very aromatic with a sweet perfumed floral note from the grenadine, leading into a spiced apple flavor in the body, and finishing floral with a very mild bitterness.  
I also tried the relatively odd recipe from *Bartender’s Choice* as their recipes tend to agree well with my palate. Using their recipe, I chose to use Beefeater as it is a more assertive gin that stands up well to lime juice. While lime juice may seem like an odd choice, a similar recipe from 1914 calls for lime juice in a Royal Smile. This version lost some of the apple and citrus notes in the nose, instead replaced by a well-rounded herbal note from the gin. While this version is more gin-forward, the other ingredients do an admirable job of reining in gin’s juniper notes, giving it a softer and rounder feel. Upon sipping I was surprised that it still retained a lot of its sweetness and starts with the fruit notes of apple and citrus, but is followed by a much clearer gin flavor and lacking any spice notes. This version I felt would be better suited for the spring or summer while the version with Tanqueray Malacca more for the current season. 
 
**Grenadine**  
I previously shared a number of recipes for making grenadine in an old post on the [Jack Rose](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1bnysd/not_cocktail_of_the_week_13_jack_rose/), so consult that for how to make grenadine as well as another simple and delicious cocktail using applejack/apple brandy. To add a bit to my knowledge on grenadine, I came across an interesting [article from Camper English on Alcademics](http://www.alcademics.com/2012/12/the-history-of-grenadine-use-in-cocktails.html) tracing the origins of grenadine in cocktails. It seems that grenadine originated from France and started appearing in American cocktails in George Kaeppler’s *Modern American Drinks* in 1895. It became quite the fad (perhaps paralleling St. Germain a few years ago?), but has persisted as a cocktail ingredient to this day.

If you somehow missed the announcement, check out the campaign to preorder a copy of the NCotW book [here](https://redditmade.com/campaign/not-cocktail-of-the-week-book). As I will be putting serious work into this project, NCotW posts may get a bit more abbreviated, but I plan on providing you guys with occasional updates. That said, now is a great time to consider contributing to /r/cocktails by writing a guest post, so contact me if you’re interested in helping out. A huge thanks to Andrew for gifting me a copy of *Death & Co: Modern Classic Cocktails* recently, I am super excited to delve into this book and share the things I learn with the rest of you. Other than that, I look forward to the usual discussions on this week’s cocktail in the comment section below. I hope some of you have the chance to play around with this cocktail, I think the combination of apple brandy and gin is very interesting and I look forward to hearing your own personal recipes for the Royal Smile. Cheers!
