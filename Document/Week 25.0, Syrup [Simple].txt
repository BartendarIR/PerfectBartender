**Not Cocktail of the Week #25: Angostura Sour**  
Hi all, /u/hebug is letting me use his weekly feature to share this great cocktail. I noticed there has been very little talk of non-potable bitter-heavy cocktails around, and thought this hopefully will expand a few palates.

**Background**  
This cocktail was created by Kirk Estopinal and published in the book Rogue Beta Cocktails, a variation on the Angostura Fizz, which itself was published in Charles Baker's *Gentlemen's Companion* in the 1930s, using half an ounce of bitters and additional rum. The Angostura Fizz has also inspired other great cocktails like the Trinidad Especial, the Stormy Mai-Tai and the Trinidad Sour. I decided to go this time with the sour because I am sure that most people reading this will already have access to all the ingredients, as well as I found it to be a good intro to this kind of cocktail. All of the aforementioned drinks work though, the cocktail ends up working pretty well despite the unusual amounts of an allegedly non-potable ingredient. 

**Recipe**  
*Beta Cocktails*  
* 1.5 oz Angostura Bitters  
* .75 oz lime juice  
* 1 oz simple syrup (1:1)  
* One egg white  

Dry shake the egg white and the lime juice.  
Add the remaining ingredients, ice and shake hard.  
Strain into chilled cocktail glass.  

**Results**  
The bitterness is not as dominant as one would first imagine. The citrus and sweetness mesh well with the spices and herbal flavours in the Angostura Bitters without masking them. The emulsifying effect of the egg white certainly rounds the flavours while also adding texture to the mouthfeel. This is one to be sipped and enjoyed very slowly.

Visually you have your usual frothy egg white head, but the color you get is fairly different than the average sour. It’s a pretty dark reddish brown that, while not the most appealing, it looks pretty interesting. Get ready to be asked what you are drinking if you order this at a sociable cocktail place. 

**Variations**  
You could certainly try to do sours based in other bitters. Peychauds would be interesting, although I think ratios might have to be changed. More than variations I first mentioned like the Trinidad Especial, Trinidad Sour, etc use a big amount of bitters but also rely on other spirits, like rye, rum and pisco and mezcal.

The Trinidad Sour (Angostura, orgeat, lemon and rye) is probably the most prominent of any of these cocktails, and more than a variation, it is likely based from the same source as the Angostura Sour.

**[Beta Cocktails](http://betacocktails.com/)**  
This is a pretty cool little book with the philosophy/manifesto of making new exciting drinks using what one would usually have available behind a bar, without the needing to do infusions or have a full deck of differently flavoured syrups. I am not in any way related to that project though, but I’m a big fan and there are certainly many great recipes there by quite a different amount of bartenders

**Links and Further Reading**  
Here are a few links with recipes of the original Angostura Fizz and some of the cocktails I’ve mentioned here:

**Cheers**  
After I first tried this type of cocktail it has certainly made me think about “non-potable bitters” and how the term is probably misnomer by now. It helped me add a bit more of depth and playfulness to cocktails, with bitters playing a more expanded role than the usual 2-3 dashes. Let me know what you think, and thanks again to hebug for letting me hijack this week’s NCotW.
