**Not Cocktail of the Week #4: Montgomery Smith**  
This week’s cocktail is my monthly foray into the modern world of cocktails, which is filled with all sorts of inventive ingredients, new techniques and creative flavor combinations. As I don’t intend to use my lab equipment for cocktails (yet), with a little more planning, I think I will be able to showcase some very interesting and creative cocktails. This month’s is a little on the simple side, but it does have some great flavors that might ward off some of the bitter cold that many have been experiencing lately. 

**Background**  
As a modern cocktail, there isn’t much background other than the short blurb provided in the *PDT Cocktail Book*. This cocktail was concocted by Nate Dumas in 2007 when he was challenged by a coworker to invent a drink called the Montgomery Smith. The mystery to me lies in where the name Montgomery Smith originated. Was it the name of his coworker? Was it someone they knew? Did the drink reflect after some particular characteristic of the person?   

**Recipe**  
From the *PDT Cocktail Book*  
* 2 oz cognac (I used Remy Martin VSOP)   
* 0.5 oz Bénédictine  
* 0.25 oz Fernet Branca   
Stirred on ice, garnish with lemon peel  

**Results**   
The Montgomery Smith is an interesting blend of fruitiness from the cognac, sweetness from the Bénédictine and bitterness from Fernet Branca. The nuances provided from the herbal sweetness of Bénédictine and the unique flavor profile of Fernet Branca manage to hold each other in check, with the Bénédictine coming through at the front and the Fernet bringing up the rear. I have a hard time balancing cocktails with Fernet Branca’s strong flavors, but this one does it admirably. 
 
**Variations**  
I have considered making this with Laird’s in substitute for the cognac, but haven’t yet had the chance. Exploring the world of cocktails solo can be a challenging endeavor so if anyone else has an opportunity to try it, let me know in the comments.  

**Bénédictine**  
As the most recent liqueur added to my bar, I’ve been finding many excuses to work it into cocktails and thought I’d share more about this ancient liqueur with you all. This post is relatively light on history so suck it up and enjoy. Bénédictine is purported to be an elixir first created by a Bénédictine monk, though given the rather sparse documentation, it is unclear how much of this story is simply a clever marketing tool. Regardless, we are told that the monk Dom Bernardo Vincelli wrote down the recipe for Bénédictine in 1510 and was rediscovered in 1863 by Alexandre Le Grand, a collector of religious art. The monk’s work dealt primarily with different aspects of alchemy, so I guess they are making allusions to Bénédictine being an attempt at the elixir of life.   
The recipe for Bénédictine remains very well guarded as a trade secret, akin to the recipe for Coca-Cola or the blend of spices for KFC chicken, but what is known is that Bénédictine is a blend of 27 herbs and spices on a cognac base and sweetened with honey. It has a very unique flavor profile that is comprised primarily of angelica, providing a sweet celery flavor; hyssop, which has a minty flavor tempered with bitterness and is also used in green chartreuse; and lemon balm, giving citrus flavors with mint undertones. The process of producing Bénédictine is rather complicated for a liqueur, starting with 4 separate distillates that are individually aged for 3 months before being blended together and aged again for 8 months. The final step is to add honey and saffron before heating and aging for a final 4 months.  
Of course such an exceptional product must have the proper terroir for aging, so Alexandre Le Grand had a palace built essentially to house the factory to produce Bénédictine in Fécamp, France. The “Palais” is open for tours and apparently also serves part time as an art gallery.

**Cheers!**  
Hopefully between the [Bobby Burns](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/169jv7/cocktail_of_the_week_3_bobby_burns/) and this, I’ve given you a solid reason to pick up Bénédictine and add it to your home bar. It’s a really great ingredient and is a very interesting liqueur to experiment with. There are a few more great cocktails using Bénédictine that I will write about in the future, so pick up a bottle now, you won’t regret it.
