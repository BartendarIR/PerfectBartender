**Not Cocktail of the Week #83: Three Dots & A Dash**  
Welcome to the first installment of NCotW Tiki Edition! Ever since my first proper Tiki experience at Smuggler’s Cove, I’ve wanted to learn more about Tiki drinks, but found that it had a steeper learning curve than cocktails in general. On top of figuring out the appropriate rum to use out of the many varieties, Tiki cocktails often need a multitude of both fresh and prepared ingredients, making them a challenge for the cocktail enthusiast. Fortunately, having NCotW gives me the opportunity and motivation to educate both myself and the /r/cocktails community as a whole about Tiki. To kick off NCotW Tiki Edition, I wanted to start by sharing one of my favorites at Smuggler’s Cove, the Three Dots & A Dash, a Tiki cocktail through and through with a blend of two rums, two citrus juices, two sweeteners, and a bit of spice all blended together to create something magical.

**Background**  
The Three Dots & A Dash is a creation by Don the Beachcomber, who along with Trader Vic (famous for the [Mai Tai], were the two founding fathers of Tiki. Unlike Trader Vic, Don the Beachcomber kept his original recipes well-guarded and was notorious for writing recipes in code, premixing ingredients in secret, and keeping his bottles label-less to keep his employees from stealing or copying his recipes. Unfortunately this meant that with Don the Beachcomber’s passing, many of his greatest concoctions were temporarily lost. Over time, as people imitated and then others further copied the imitations, the genius of his creations was diluted and we ended up with the syrupy sweet messes that became associated with Tiki cocktails. Thanks to the tireless effort of Jeff “Beachbum” Berry as an archeologist/historian (a much tamer Indiana Jones), many of these long-lost drinks were finally formalized and codified. Not enough praise can be given to Jeff “Beachbum” Berry, who I would consider one of the modern disciples of Tiki that played a massive part in making modern Tiki revival possible. The Three Dots & A Dash comes from his fourth book, *Sippin’ Safari*, published in 2007. This Tiki cocktail was created to commemorate the victorious return of soldiers from World War II, which the dates this cocktail to the late 1940s, and its name further commemorates their victory as it is in reference to the Morse code for the letter “V”, short for victory.

**Results**  
To establish a proper state of reference for this drink, I made a trip to Smuggler’s Cove and sampled their version of the Three Dots & A Dash. Though my tasting notes at the bar are brief, I first noted an exotic herb and tropical notes in the nose, which I attributed to the falernum and allspice dram. This drink really exemplifies how Tiki drinks become more than the sum of their parts, smoothly blending distinctive ingredients together into a cohesive and well-balanced whole. This meant it was particularly difficult for me to pick out any specific taste notes, but instead it came across as a well-balanced and very smooth drink. At the end I did get a bit of the papery and grassy notes I associate with fresh sugar cane (I drank so much fresh pressed sugar cane juice in Singapore), which are apparently quite strong in the Duquesne Rhum Agricole (Élevé Sous Bois?) that Smuggler’s Cove uses in this cocktail.  
At some point, I was convinced that my Flor de Cana 4-Year Old Gold rum would suffice for the amber Martinician rhum in this drink and I whipped one up using it in conjunction with my El Dorado 12 (first seen in my post on the [Bumbo & Rum Manhattan](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/27wec2/not_cocktail_of_the_week_75_bumbo_rum_manhattan/)). While it was enjoyably refreshing and described as smooth, light, fruity, and spicy, I did cut a lot of corners making this version since I didn’t use the proper ~~rum~~ rhum, and merely shook the drink hard rather than a brief blending.  
To rectify that, I eventually purchased a proper rhum agricole to do this cocktail justice for NCotW, going with the oft-recommended Rhum Clement VSOP. I also crushed precisely 6 oz of ice after determining that each cube from my standard Tovolo tray was 1 oz. Finally, I discovered that my hand blender came with an attachment strikingly similar to the spindle blender used to mix the majority of drinks at Smuggler’s Cove and so used this to briefly blend. My proper version of the Three Dots & A Dash had a heady aroma of cherry and ripe pineapple from the garnish, with background notes of spice and ~~rum~~ rhum. Its texture was very similar to the version at Smuggler’s Cove, very smooth with a medium body, and similarly very refreshing (which was especially well-appreciated after the hour I spent preparing and photographing this cocktail). Up front, I first tasted some smoky sugary notes from the demerara rum mixed with a mild citrus note thanks to the blend of lime and orange juice. At this point, the magic of Tiki (or my inexperience in tasting) takes over and I lose any real ability to pick out specific flavors, returning only to pick out some allspice and clove on the finish. The grassy note that I got at Smuggler’s Cove was more diminished in my version, but if I focused and waited, I believe I got a faint lingering sticky grassiness on my palate. Eating the garnish of this drink is always a pleasurable indulgence, since the “three dots” part of this drink is always three Luxardo Maraschino cherries, but is especially so at home since I add a wedge of fresh pineapple for the “dash” (Smuggler’s Cove uses an inedible pineapple leaf).
