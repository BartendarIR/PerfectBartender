**Not Cocktail of the Week #112: Old Ironsides**  
I’ve been slowly working through the relatively accessible recipes in *Death + Co.* over the past few months and over the next few NCotW posts, I hope to share a handful of those that have stood out to me. To kick things off, I want to share the Old Ironsides, a cocktail I found particularly interesting because of its successful use of the assertively molasses-y blackstrap rum. I hope that by sharing it with a wider audience, its framework will inspire more cocktails along these lines.

**Background**  
The Old Ironsides is found in the Death + Co. book, credited to bartender Brian Miller in 2009. The short blurb accompanying it states, “Black strap rum is tricky: you can’t use a lot or it will take over the drink. I almost always use it as a modifier.” While I’ve used black strap rum to make an incredibly delicious and complex [Jungle Bird](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2e3p09/not_cocktail_of_the_week_85_tiki_edition_jungle/) or the occasional Corn ‘n Oil, I’ve often wished there was another way to utilize it. Discovering this cocktail and the thought process behind it has given me a few ideas and resulted in a relatively interesting variation I will share later.  
This cocktail calls specifically for Scarlet Ibis rum, which I’ve never seen despite the spectrum of rums I picked up during NCotW Tiki Edition last year. Originally a privately commissioned rum for Death + Co., it is now sold in stores, but may be somewhat East Coast-centric given its background. Scarlet Ibis is a 98-proof blend of 3-5 year-old Trinidadian copper pot-distilled rum. It is commonly described as having a nose of vanilla, a bit of estery funk, and some sugar and spice; in terms of flavor it is primarily brown sugar, more vanilla, with notes of coffee and caramel; it finally finishes with toffee, chocolate and cinnamon (Flavor notes from [Kindred Cocktails](http://www.kindredcocktails.com/ingredient/scarlet-ibis), [Jeff ‘Beachbum’ Berry](http://beachbumberry.com/the-bum-on-rum/), [Capn Jimbo](http://rumproject.com/rumforum/viewtopic.php?p=902&sid=6f1442703fa3a26c68647a9fbd85478f), and [Chemistry of the Cocktail](http://cocktailchem.blogspot.com/2012/02/rum-review-scarlet-ibis.html)). While every country produces a distinct style of rum, Trinidadian rum seems to lie somewhere between Jamaican funk and Cuban smooth, which brought to mind Barbadian rum, which is also copper pot-distilled and I find has a mild ester fruitiness with loads of brown sugar and vanilla flavor. With that in mind, I selected the Mt. Gay XO (which I got for a steal at $26) for the Old Ironsides.  

**Recipes**  
*Death & Co.*, David Kaplan, 2014  
* 1.5 oz Scarlet Ibis rum  
* 0.5 oz Cruzan Black Strap rum  
* 1 oz Dolin Rouge vermouth  
* 1 tsp Lazzaroni amaretto  
* 1 dash Fee Brothers whiskey barrel-aged bitters  
Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into a coupe. No garnish.  

*Links and Further Reading*  
There are no links because it seems like nobody has written about this one yet.  

**Results**  
Breaking down the 5-ingredient recipe, this is essentially a [Rum Manhattan](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/27wec2/not_cocktail_of_the_week_75_bumbo_rum_manhattan/), with the rum component split between two different styles of rum and an extra accent from the tsp of amaretto. As previously mentioned, I used Mt. Gay XO to replace Scarlet Ibis rum and used Angostura bitters as the aromatic bitters component. My brief notes from my initial tasting read, “Smoky molasses-y take on rum manhattan, perhaps a touch more amaretto or coffee liqueur would be nice.” With a return visit to the Old Ironsides and a bit more concerted effort in tasting, I first found a nose primarily comprised of the rich sweet notes of rum with fresh fruitiness of the Dolin Rouge on top. In the mouth it started with sugary vanilla notes from the aged rum, which mixed with the fruit and herbal notes of vermouth, followed by a reveal of a deep funky molasses note from the black strap rum, and finishing with Angostura spices and a very faint nuttiness from the amaretto.  
Following my initial notes, I also tried a version replacing the lighter Dolin Rouge with Carpano Antica for its rich vanilla and stronger herbal bitterness with just a touch more amaretto (0.25 oz or 1.5 tsp) to compensate. I found this version incredibly rich and delicious. Aroma-wise it was similar, but the molasses came forward a bit more accompanied by vanilla. Flavor-wise, in place of the fruit notes, the Carpano Antica really amplified the deep molasses flavor behind the sugary rum with a slightly more prevalent sweet almond note near the dry bitter finish. This was a seriously amped up and intensely flavored Rum Manhattan.

**Variations**  
I thought it would be fun for me to try constructing original drinks based off the theory and lessons I’m learning from *Death + Co.*, so accompanying the Old Ironsides, I present the Kalakala. As a native Seattleite, this variation is named in honor of the once beautifully art deco, but recently-scrapped ferry that I personally only recall as a rusted out hull moored in Union Bay, near the University of Washington (read more history in this [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Kalakala)). For the Kalakala, I continued using Carpano Antica for its rich flavor, but replaced the Lazzaroni Amaretto with St. George NOLA coffee liqueur (giving it that unique Seattle coffee angle), and finished it with a dash of Bittermen’s Xocolatl Mole bitters to further amplify the coffee notes with complementary chocolate and spice flavors.  
* 1.5 oz Mt. Gay XO rum  
* 0.5 oz Cruzan Black Strap rum  
* 1.0 oz Carpano Antica sweet vermouth  
* 0.25 oz St. George NOLA coffee liqueur  
* 1 dash Bittermen’s Xocolatl Mole bitters  
Stir on ice, strain, no garnish.  

The nose of the Kalakala is surprisingly bright and spicy with a hint of acidic coffee notes. It starts up front with sweet vanilla and earthy notes before transitioning to an intensely chocolate flavor from the combination of black strap and the xocolatl mole bitters. It finishes with a dark spicy coffee flavor, evoking my memories of the cinnamon-spiked Mexican coffee served at Agua Verde, a Mexican restaurant very close to where I used to work/study at the University of Washington. This was a very complex cocktail with a lot of distinct but complementary waves of flavor. 

**Cheers!**  
I hope you’ve enjoyed this edition of NCotW and perhaps even been inspired by it. I definitely was excited to play with the recipe a bit and find a new delicious way to use black strap rum. If you have the chance to try the Old Ironsides, my variation the Kalakala, or concoct something new derived from this, I’d love to hear about it in the comments. Otherwise, the usual feedback and any questions are welcome. Also, I’d like to specifically mention that guest posts are welcome in any format, whether through the usual channel of contacting me to find a time for you to post them and reap your generous “reward”, or by sending content for me to edit/post at my choosing (as suggested by /u/dakkeh [here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/32ue35/trashy_cocktail_of_the_week_2_the_chameleon/cqjsspp?context=3)). Sorry that some of you are disappointed to find that NCotW is no longer a regular weekly thing, but if I have enough regular guest contributors, perhaps it can come closer to being weekly again. I, for one, do enjoy the newfound freedom and flexibility because it lets me better enjoy this hobby of mine. Anyways, thanks for all the continued support and maybe I’ll be back next week. Cheers!
