**Not Cocktail of the Week #90: Sloe Gin Fizz**  
Ever since first tasting sloe gin at the Alembic, I’ve wanted my own bottle. Unfortunately, options for good quality sloe gin are rather limited, Plymouth probably being the only one relatively available. While recounting and discussing this with /u/AlmightyJ at one of my visits to Bourbon & Branch, he mentioned there was an amazing local sloe gin made by Spirit Works up north in Sebastopol, CA. Given my recent rum detour, I still hadn’t gotten around to buying sloe gin, but when I stumbled across it browsing my local BevMo one day, I quickly snapped it up. As with any new ingredient I add to my bar, I taste it alone to establish a base flavor profile, and then try it in some simple classic cocktails to see how it changes when mixed. For sloe gin, that meant making a Sloe Gin Fizz, which is an awesome way to salute the end of summer and transition into the flavors of fall. 

**Background**  
The Sloe Gin Fizz has no distinctive origin story as it is a variation of the simple Gin Fizz, which hails from the 1887 reprint of the Jerry Thomas’ *Bartender’s Guide: How to Mix Drinks* as the Gin Fiz. In the same vein as new cocktails made today, bartenders probably looked at their bottle of sloe berry-infused gin and thought that using it in a Gin Fizz would be a unique twist. According to *The Art of the Shim* by Dinah Sanders, the Sloe Gin Fizz first appeared in *Sunset Magazine* in 1898. More often, J. A. Grohusko’s *Jack’s Manual* from 1910 is credited as the first published instance of the Sloe Gin Fizz.  
After looking at the recipes below, one unappreciated subtlety is the difference between a Fizz and a Collins. Both cocktails have remarkably similar recipes and due to the popularity of the Ramos Gin Fizz, people often may think that a Fizz includes egg white while a Collins omits it. David Embury tackles this question in considerable unsurprising depth in *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*, attributing the root difference being in the type of soda water used. The Collins used the “modern bottled carbonated waters”, which he believes releases its carbonation much more slowly, thus making the Collins better suited for prolonged enjoyment.  
>The Collins is made in a tall glass (14 to 16 ounces) with several ice cubes or an equivalent amount of cracked ice in the glass and with charged water poured in slowly and the whole drink stirred very briefly in order that it may retain its carbonation as long as possible. The drink should be clear, like a Highball, and should never be permitted to “fizz”.   

On the other hand, the Fizz was to be made with the traditional seltzer water from a soda jerk that “delivers a fine stream of the carbonated water under high pressure into the glass”.  This resulted in a cocktail that should be enjoyed quickly while fresh. 
>The Fizz, on the other hand, should be thoroughly frappéed with fine ice (three or even five minutes of shaking are none too long), after which it is strained into a 6- to 8-ounce glass and “fizzed” by adding charged water in a fine stream under pressure.  

This effect can be replicated today by using an old-fashioned soda siphon or possibly by repeatedly charging your water in a SodaStream machine. One last nuance, while Collins drinks are often garnished, Fizzes are served ungarnished.

**Results**  
Lacking a proper Fizz glass and having no idea where to get one, I serendipitously found that the tasting glasses provided at beer festivals or from brewery tours serve as a remarkably good facsimile of a Fizz glass as they generally hold a volume of 6-8 oz. To the familiar ratio of 2 oz spirit, 1 oz sour, 0.75 oz sweet, I topped it off after shaking with 3 oz fresh soda water. My resulting Sloe Gin Fizz using Spirit Works Sloe Gin was tart, fruity, a bit earthy, and incredibly refreshing. I can see how this would be a pleasant and invigorating low-alcohol pick-me-up to start off your morning and would love to see this served at more brunch functions. On the nose, the Sloe Gin Fizz is very light with a hint of tart stone fruit. In the mouth, this translates to an earthy fruitiness up front from the bitter sloe berries. It is immediately followed by a tart lemon note augmented by the sparkly zing of soda water which fades away during the finish leaving just the aromatic components of lemon, a return of the fruity sloe berry flavor, and a dry puckering finish. I think I might reverse my ratio of lemon and syrup next time as I found the soda water really amplifies the tart flavors. 

**Variations**  
While there are no less than 31 variations on the Gin Fizz in David Embury’s *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*, the best known is the [Ramos Gin Fizz](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/18c2wl/not_cocktail_of_the_week_6_special_mardi_gras/). I would say the Silver Gin Fizz, which adds egg white to the basic Gin Fizz may be the second best known. Another variation, the Diamond Fizz, which uses sparkling wine in place of seltzer water, seems incredibly similar to a French 75.  

**Sloe Gin**  
Before I ever encountered sloe gin, I thought it was “slow gin” and thus was gin made by some slow-distillation process. After learning that it was “sloe gin”, named after the sloe berry, I still had no idea what to expect. The sloe berry is the brutally sour and highly astringent fruit of the prickly blackthorn bush native to England, closely related to plums like damson plums or Atlantic beach plums. While most of America is familiar with sloe gin as a fruity, syrupy and artificially flavored mess from their early drinking years, real sloe gin has a much classier history, hailing from rural England where creative farmers found a palatable use for these wild berries on their land. Sloe gin is traditionally made by infusing ripe sloe berries that have been pricked with a needle in still-strength gin with a touch of sugar for 2 to 12 months, resulting in a liqueur with a unique sloe berry flavor of sour cherry and a hint of almond from the sloe berry pits.  While the fresh tart and fruity result seems like it would be best suited to drinking on a hot summer day, according to Plymouth’s master distiller, Britons traditionally enjoyed this over the winter while hunting. Plymouth makes its sloe gin using a recipe from 1883, infusing their still-strength gin with sloe berries for four months. Similarly, Spirit Works makes their sloe gin in a traditional way, infusing sloe berries with their gin according to an old family recipe (read more [here](http://www.sonomamag.com/serious-gin-game/#.VCME9PldU2Y)). The Bitter Truth, probably better known for their bitters, is also said to make a good quality sloe gin if you have it available. If you can only find or have the Hiram Walker or DeKuyper brands, I often encountered people using it by mixing it with an equal part of gin for use in cocktails.  

**Cheers!**  
Thanks for reading and for all the support. In case you missed it, I had a milestone in my cocktail journey last weekend bartending the wedding of my friends (see [here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2h9i38/i_bartended_a_wedding_last_weekend/)). If you have the opportunity to lay your hands on some traditional sloe gin, I hope you will make and enjoy a Sloe Gin Fizz. I’ll be at a conference next week, but /u/spodyody should be filling in with a great guest post. Other than that, I look forward to your questions and comments. Cheers!
