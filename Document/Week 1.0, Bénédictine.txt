**Cocktail of the Week #3: Bobby Burns**  
  
I’m going to give a shot at taking over this weekly cocktail feature and use it as a platform to showcase new cocktails that I’ve come across and enjoyed. This week’s cocktail is the Bobby Burns cocktail, which first appeared in the *Savoy Cocktail Book*, which is an essential book to own in this day and age of classic cocktails. I chose this cocktail because I’ve felt like I don’t have many scotch-based cocktails in my repertoire (other than the Rusty Nail and the Blood and Sand) and I really ended up enjoying this one.  
  
**Background**  
The Bobby Burns cocktail is named after the Scottish poet Robert Burns, who is known as the national poet of Scotland and beat out William Wallace for the title of “The Greatest Scot” on Scottish TV. I also learned writing this post that he composed the words to Auld Lang Syne, so we’ve all undoubtedly been exposed to and/or participated in a reading of his work. 
  
**Recipe**  
There are a few recipes that you can find online, but the original recipe in the *Savoy Cocktail Book* is:  
* 1/2 Scotch whiskey  
* 1/2 Italian vermouth  
* 3 dashes Benedictine  
Stirred on ice and strained  
Garnish with a lemon peel

**Results**  
For my first attempt at this I went with what was currently my only scotch whiskey, Glenkinchie 12, which is one of the few single malts from the Lowland region, which I enjoy as a nicely balanced example of scotch. Disclaimer: I made a cocktail from a single malt scotch, but I recently moved and am still in the process of restocking my bar so I worked with what I had. For the Italian vermouth aka sweet vermouth, I stuck to my usual, Dolin Rouge, which I find is a relatively mild and slightly herbaceous vermouth. Benedictine was obviously Benedictine, but I used 1 barspoon of it as I don’t have a good way to dash from the full sized bottle and I’m pretty confident that isn’t intended.   
It was a great cocktail, the addition of vermouth and Benedictine really added to generate a pleasantly fresh fruity note, while still retaining the bitterness, brininess and smokiness of scotch on the finish. I did find that 1 barspoon was a little too much Benedictine, so I would recommend a scant barspoon to anyone measuring with a barspoon.   
I also went out and bought a bottle of Chivas Regal 12, which is a blended scotch, because I knew that I would be enjoying this cocktail for a time and I just felt guilty using single malt, and it was just as delicious. I had a friend comment that this sounded like a Manhattan, which is my go-to cocktail, but it’s probably halfway between that and a Rusty Nail, which is probably why I enjoyed this cocktail so much.  
  
**Variations**  
As seen in the *Imbibe* recipe, modern versions of this cocktail start to skew towards being more spirit-forward  by using more scotch, so if you enjoy your cocktails with more bite, give it a shot.  
Another variation that I have considered, but not yet tried, is to substitute the Benedictine with Drambuie, which shares a similar flavor profile to Benedictine, and is having somewhat of a resurgence in popularity. Both Drambuie and Benedictine are sweet liqueurs with honey, herbs and spices. Drambuie is whiskey-based, while Benedictine is cognac-based, so perhaps Drambuie could potentially fit even better.  
  
**Cheers!**  
Hope you’ve enjoyed adding or rediscovering this classic scotch-based cocktail. Sorry, no photo this week as I didn’t plan on writing this column, but if people like it, I’ll definitely get a picture for next week. Share your thoughts with me below.
