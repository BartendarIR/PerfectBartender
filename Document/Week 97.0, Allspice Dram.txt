**Not Cocktail of the Week #98: Flannel Shirt**  
Big thanks last week to /u/_chrono for his great work writing a guest post on the [Toronto](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2le79y/not_cocktail_of_the_week_96_toronto_fernet_branca/) and including a short feature on the misunderstood Fernet Branca. This week I want to share the Flannel Shirt, a modern cocktail featured in Jeffrey Morgenthaler’s recent book, *The Bar Book*. It’s one of the very few cocktails using Scotch that I’ve gone back to repeatedly, especially since it captures the autumn season so beautifully.  

**Background**  
The Flannel Shirt was created by Jeffrey Morgenthaler* for the StarChefs Portland Rising Star Awards held in 2011. He was originally approached by Highland Park Scotch to create a cocktail for this ceremony in November and initially struggled to come up with a harmonious concoction using Scotch, but had the brilliant insight of pairing it with fresh apple cider. He found that the earthy notes of fresh-pressed apple cider would complement the Scotch well while adding its unique seasonal sweetness. Throwing in allspice dram and Averna, a spicy Italian amaro, he created a cocktail that he describes as “a hot drink that you’d have on Thanksgiving morning—only served cold.” It’s the perfect choice for any upcoming Thanksgiving parties you may be hosting or attending with its refreshing sweet, spicy, and slightly smoky flavor that goes down very easy.

**Results**  
It is important to use a proper American-style apple cider for this cocktail, which is a nonalcoholic, fresh-pressed, and unfiltered apple juice. I never tried using a more commercial standard apple juice, but I think it lacks the depth and flavor of a proper apple cider, especially if you get it in season at a local farmer’s market.  
I admit I first made this using Ramazzotti in place of the Averna, since that was what I had on hand and it is a commonly suggested substitute for Averna. However, after I picked up a bottle of Averna to make a batch of Flannel Shirt cocktails for a party, I spent some time tasting the two Amari side by side and I think I understand why the recipe specifies Averna. While both are bitter and sweet with an underlying menthol note, I found that Averna had spice and herbal notes while Ramazzoti had more citrus fruit notes. Thus Averna better complements the autumnal flavors of allspice, Scotch and apple that define this drink.  
As for the actual experience, I found that the Flannel Shirt starts with a sturdy citrus note in the nose due to the generous orange twist, complemented by fresh apple and a touch of smoky Scotch. Drinking it, I first get sweet and fresh apple up front with its flavors brightened by the touch of lemon juice. The Scotch then enters, first complementing the apple with its own fruit notes and mild woodiness, then transitioning to a light smokiness. This fades to reveal the flavors of allspice and a mild herbal bitterness on the finish. With its significant portion of apple cider, I find this drink incredibly quaffable and a huge crowd pleaser. It is a well-balanced and refreshing cocktail that I feel captures the season of autumn perfectly.  

**Cheers!**  
I truly hope that many of you are able to try this creation from one of my cocktail idols, Jeffrey Morgenthaler. If you haven’t already, please check out my [campaign on redditmade for the “Not Cocktail of the Week” book](https://redditmade.com/campaign/not-cocktail-of-the-week-book), which will feature a foreword written by Jeffrey Morgenthaler himself. If I haven’t gushed about him enough, you can read another of his recipes in my NCotW post on the [Amaretto Sour](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1vvuw7/not_cocktail_of_the_week_55_amaretto_sour/) from earlier this year. In any case, I had a lot of success serving a liter of premixed Flannel Shirts for a recent cocktail party (which is actually only 8 servings) and I hope that this might inspire you to do the same. If you do, I hope you share your experience in the comments below, or if you have any other thoughts or feedback on the Flannel Shirt. Next week should be a simple classic cocktail, but until then dear readers, cheers!
