**Not Cocktail of the Week #84: Hotel Nacional Special**  
Welcome back to the second installment of NCotW Tiki Edition! For this week’s cocktail, we are going to use a Spanish-style rum/ron in a fruit-forward and crowd-pleasing twist on a Daiquiri. 

**Background**  
The Hotel Nacional Special was created at the Hotel Nacional de Cuba in the 1930s, which was one of the grandest bastions for well-off American travelers seeking cocktails during Prohibition. They have counted Winston Churchill, Frank Sinatra, Mickey Mantle, Ernest Hemingway, and Rocky Marciano among others as their guests. The Hotel Nacional Special cocktail is credited to Wil. P Taylor, who previously was the manager at the Old Waldorf-Astoria hotel (a location notable for hosting the [Clover Club]( http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1go8m1/not_cocktail_of_the_week_24_clover_club/), creating the [Bronx]( http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/221kjr/not_cocktail_of_the_week_65_bronx_income_tax/) and potentially the [Jack Rose]( http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1bnysd/not_cocktail_of_the_week_13_jack_rose/)) before fleeing to Cuba during Prohibition. The Hotel Nacional de Cuba was well-known for its cocktails and had two other influential bartenders working there at the time, Eddie Woelke and Fred Kaufman, who share credit for creating the [Mary Pickford](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/265iu6/not_cocktail_of_the_week_72_mary_pickford/) and El Presidente. Lots of history and cocktails tangled up in this noteworthy crew.

**Results**  
As with last week, I tasted this cocktail at Smuggler’s Cove as a reference point, with my brief notes and recollections pieced together here. Visually, I immediately noted sizeable bubbles forming a pleasing layer on top since they use fresh muddled pineapple that is then briefly blended on the spindle blender. Their version started with big apricot note in the nose with a hint of rum encapsulated in the previously mentioned bubbles. Flavor-wise, I found it intensely fruity with the apricot and pineapple well balanced with tart lime serving as a counterpoint. The rum was less notable, but served as a backbone adding some supplemental sugar notes and contributing to the clean finish. I wasn’t able to tell if they used a white or gold rum though.    
For my first version, I unintentionally used white rum despite *The PDT Cocktail Book* calling for gold as I initially planned to write about the Hotel Nacional cocktail which uses white rum and I assumed this version would be closely related. In any case, this version of the Hotel Nacional Special starts with crisp lime and fruity pineapple notes in the nose. Up front, I get sweet pineapple flavor, rounded out and deepened by a subtle hint of stone fruit. This cocktail has a smooth and moderate texture which I attribute to the pineapple juice. Rum is introduced in the body of this cocktail, mixing with the fruit notes, then persists through to the finish where it mingles with some bitter lime oil notes. This recipe is quite generous, with a pre-shake volume of >4 oz, so if you’re using a relatively small coupe (like me), you might end up with a bit left over in your shaker. It might be a better fit in one of my stubby medium-sized Martini/Cosmo glasses. I also have a hard time placing the apricot flavor in this relatively generous cocktail, but it still manages to be a nicely balanced cocktail that retains qualities of a Daiquiri while including lots of pineapple flavor.  
After receiving *The Bar Book* by Jeffrey Morgenthaler from a generous NCotW reader, I saw that he also had included a recipe for the Hotel Nacional Special, so I set out to make and try his version. I also realized I should be using a gold rum as is called for in the original recipe, the recipe from *The PDT Cocktail Book*, and others, reaching for my trusty Flor de Cana 4-year Gold. Having also bought a couple pineapples for NCotW Tiki Edition, I easily made the pineapple syrup he calls for. This version first had a visually striking and impressively long-lasting creamy head from the pineapple syrup. Perhaps something about macerating pineapple with sugar increases the foaming potential of pineapple. The nose of this version of the Hotel Nacional Special is very appetizing, full of tropical pineapple, rich apricot, and fresh lime. The additional thickness provided by the apricot brandy and pineapple syrup gives it a smooth and luxurious mouthfeel. This cocktail really impressed me with its balance and transition between different flavors, starting first with pineapple and tart lime, then bitter lime and sweet apricot, and finishing with earthy apricot and rum. Each individual flavor leads seamlessly to another, while showing their different aspects over time. I initially worried that the 0.75 oz of pineapple syrup and 0.5 oz of apricot brandy would result in it being overly sweet, but it somehow works either because the syrup is diluted with pineapple juice and/or because the slight bitterness from the drop of Angostura bitters dampens the sweet sensation.  
Inspired by this flavor profile and with my extra servings of pineapple syrup, I thought that adding some funky Jamaican rum to the fruity mix could be exciting, so I did a version with equal parts Flor de Cana 4-year Gold and Smith & Cross rum. This version had a lush and fruity aroma, with the funkiness from the Smith & Cross amping up the fruity pineapple and earthy apricot notes. I was surprised at how different this drink felt due to the assertive and higher proof Smith & Cross, which really gave it a juicy and lush sensation. I first got the pineapple, Jamaican funk and sour lime up front, transitioning into apricot and rum, and finishing with rum, bitter lime and a return of the funk that lingers on the palate. I think this version has promise, but next time I need to either back off on the Smith & Cross, or use rich pineapple syrup to brighten it up.
