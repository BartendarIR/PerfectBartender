I’d like to thank /u/hebug for the opportunity to present this weeks NCotW! The doctored IPhone photos weren’t exactly what I had in mind but unfortunately my wife decided to take our camera with her on an extended trip to the beach. Nonetheless, I present you the Rattlesnake!
 
**History**
 
The earliest recorded existence for the Rattlesnake cocktail that I could find was from Harry Craddock’s “The Savoy Cocktail Book” published in 1930. Craddock compliments the traditional whiskey sour with a few dashes of absinthe a practice that became popular in the early 1900s. Craddock notes “It will either cure Rattlesnake bite, or kill Rattlesnakes, or make you see them.”
 
The whiskey sour itself has a long history. It is one of the original drinks in the iconic Jerry Thomas' Bartender's Guide from 1862. Even earlier, the whiskey sour is rumored to have been the official drink of the 184-year-old Jefferson Literary and Debating Society at the University of Virginia, the oldest continuously existing collegiate debating club founded in 1825. David Wondrich’s research for Imbibe! found that the oldest known sour recipe dates back to a Toronto hotel’s 1856 drink list.
 
Jerry Thomas’s Whiskey Sour calls for dissolving powdered sugar in seltzer water. Gary Regan notes in The Joy of Mixology that the practice of making sours with simple syrup instead of soda started with George Kappeler in 1895. later in 1922, the great Anglo-Belgian bartender Robert Vermiere suggested that “a few drops of white of egg improve all Sours.” This, the European school of Sour-making, was the one that recolonized America after Prohibition, and the Sour with a head on it was a standard specialty of FDR-era Cocktail lounges.

**Results**
 
I have always loved a well made Whiskey Sour but I have to admit that the simple addition of Absinthe in this cocktail adds a very nice complexity that seems to elevate the drink overall and counter balances the other components. The egg white adds a rich texture and creaminess that in combination with the Absinthe transitions the seasonality of the classic Whiskey Sour to a year round cocktail. The original Savoy version is a little too light on the lemon/sugar to whiskey ratio for me personally, the Bartenders Manual is slightly too sweet using a 1:1 lemon to sugar ratio, and PDT's seems a touch heavy on the lemon. I also found it interesting that The American Cocktail Book did not use a dry shake and was the only version to garnish with a lemon peel. Find the right ratio for your personal tastes, kick back and enjoy. On that note lets talk a little bit about citrus/sugar ratios.
 
**Citrus/Sugar Ratios:**
 
Dave Wondrich notes that the only real question that remains today regarding the whiskey sour is the ratio of sugar to lemon. He claims that if you want to get a mixologist riled, tell him he’s put too much sugar in his Sour. Supposedly there were essentially two schools: those who took the name seriously, and the non-literalists. The former, including the author of the Steward & Barkeeper’s Manual and whoever reworked the Professor’s book, call for the juice of half of a lemon and a teaspoon or so of sugar-tart! But Jerry Thomas, Harry Johnson, George Kappeler, and Bill Boothby—lean towards a sweeter version, restricting the lemon juice to a few dashes or a quarter of a lemon’s worth at most, and making sure that there’s plenty of sweet to balance. By the 1880s, the original 1 tablespoonful of sugar was considered excessive, and the amount was reduced by half to two-thirds. In the end its a matter of tastes and its flexibility here is one of the things I love most about the sour and its offspring.
