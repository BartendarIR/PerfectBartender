**Not Cocktail of the Week #19: Intro to Aperol**  
For this round of NCotW’s modern cocktail (has anyone even noticed I feature one simple, one modern, and two classic cocktails each rotation?), I thought I would share this cocktail that I recently came across and has become a new favorite. The Intro to Aperol is a crowd-pleasing light and classy cocktail that serves well as a summer sipper. 

**Background**  
The Intro to Aperol cocktail was created by Audrey Saunders, owner of the well-regarded cocktail lounge Pegu Club in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City. Named for famous cocktail bar that was the birthplace of the eponymously named Pegu Club cocktail (written up as a NCotW guest post by /u/ClamydiaDellArte [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1c3psn/not_cocktail_of_the_week_14_pegu_club/)), the modern Pegu Club which opened in 2006 served as one of the turning points that led to the revival of classic cocktails. Audrey Saunders has been and still is a major player in the cocktail world, having started her storied career thanks to a seminar given by Dale DeGroff in the 1990s, going on to manage a number of successful bar programs in New York City, and most recently, marrying Robert Hess (which was a notable enough event to have an [article in the NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/31/fashion/weddings/audrey-saunders-and-robert-hess-vows.html)), another very recognizable name in the cocktail world. She has helped bring products like Chartreuse and Punt e Mes to America, and is, according to David Wondrich, a “research mixologist, applying scientific method to her cocktails,” whose experiments helped pioneer the idea of infusions. The Intro to Aperol cocktail that she created is one of a handful of what she calls “inverted drinks”, which feature low-alcohol ingredients as the main component, rather than the 80-100 proof spirits that are typical. 

**Recipes**

**Results**  
Since I learned of this cocktail from the *Bartender’s Choice* app for the iPhone, which I occasionally use as a great tool to discover new cocktails and highly recommend, I use their modified recipe without simple syrup. I initially fell in love with this cocktail because of its amazingly clear progression of flavors, but it is also a very well balanced cocktail that is light enough to be able enjoy a few of on a warm day. The aroma of this cocktail is rather light, comprised primarily of lemon oils from the garnish with a little bit of citrus sweetness from Aperol. Upon sipping, it is pleasantly sweet and smooth, due to the relatively low proof, with a full texture provided by the thickness of Aperol. The sweetness clearly transitions into the tartness of lemon, which fades to reveal the spicy bitter finish of Angostura, and finally finishes with the mild lingering bitter and drying sensation of Aperol. If you are not a fan of Campari, this is still worth a shot and may serve as a delicious stepping stone to Italian amari.  

**Variations**  
I suppose one could try substituting a different amaro for Aperol, but the resulting cocktail would likely requiring some retooling since Aperol is a relatively sweet amaro. Still, the idea of an “inverted” cocktail is a field that remains relatively unexplored, but like the Chrysanthemum cocktail, can be surprisingly delicious. If you are familiar with other inverted cocktails that utilize a low proof alcohol as its main component, I’d love to hear about them in the comments.  

**Aperol**  
Aperol is probably most easily described as the sweet little sister to her rough-and-tumble big brother Campari. They share a similar flavor profile, but Aperol is sweeter and lower in alcohol (~20 proof), with a stronger orange characteristic and less of the bitterness that some find unappealing. It originates from two brothers, Luigi and Silvio Barbieri, who first introduced their low-alcohol spirit at the Padua Exhibition in 1919. Its major flavor components are of orange and rhubarb, with bitterness provided by gentian and cinchona. Aperol is very popular and commonly found in Europe as a Spritz, a very light and refreshing cocktail simply comprised of equal parts Prosecco sparkling wine, the amaro of your choice, and sparkling water. It can also substitute quite well in a Negroni variation utilizing Hendrick’s Gin, which is itself a much lighter and delicate gin, and Lillet Blanc, known as an Unusual Negroni. If you despise the taste of Campari because of its medicinal qualities, perhaps Aperol will be more up your alley as a much friendlier and appealing amaro.

**Cheers!**  
Thanks for everybody’s continued support and enjoyment of this regular feature. Hopefully I’ve introduced another great cocktail for you to try at home, and if so, share your experience of it in the comments below. Suggestions for improvement and further questions are also appreciated in the comments. If you are interested in contributing a particularly favorite cocktail of your own and sharing it with the rest of us, feel free to contact me and we can schedule a guest column for you.
