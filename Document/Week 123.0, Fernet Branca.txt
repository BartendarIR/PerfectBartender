**Not Cocktail of the Week #123: Hanky Panky**  
Well, let’s try and keep this ball rolling shall we? This week I want to share a cocktail that holds a special place in my heart, the Hanky Panky. I believe this was one of the first drinks that /u/AlmightyJ served me at Bourbon and Branch when I expressed interest in learning more about Fernet Branca. I think he chose it as an introduction because all things considered, it is relatively light on the Fernet, much as the Jasmine is a good introduction to Campari. 

**Background**  
The Hanky Panky is a rare bird, in that not only it is a classic cocktail with a clearly documented history, but it was originally concocted by a woman. The Hanky Panky was created by [Ada ‘Coley’ Coleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Coleman#/media/File:Ada_Coleman_small_20110507-1109.jpg), head bartender at The Savoy Hotel’s American Bar from 1903-1925. As the oft-quoted story goes (as recalled by Ada Coleman herself), Charles Hawtrey, a comedic actor, approached her and said:  
>“Coley, I am tired. Give me something with a bit of punch in it.” It was for him that I [Ada Coleman] spent hours experimenting until I had invented a new cocktail. The next time he came in, I told him I had a new drink for him. He sipped it, and, draining the glass, he said “By Jove! This is the real hanky-panky!”  

And thus a classic cocktail was born. ‘Coley’ herself was, and still may be, an underappreciated figure in classic cocktail history. She started her career at Claridge’s Hotel in 1899 (a name that may also be familiar from the [Claridge](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/wiki/ncotw/claridge) cocktail) before being promoted to head bartender at The Savoy in 1903. She reigned there until they closed for renovations in 1925, which then reopened with Harry Craddock, the familiar author of *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, at the helm. She was well-loved during that period and served such notable figures as Mark Twain, Charlie Chaplin, and numerous English nobles.  
Many credit her with making The Savoy the famed institution it is today, yet this is the only cocktail in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* credited to her. [Some speculate](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/24/what-ended-the-career-of-the-world-s-first-celebrity-female-bartender.html) that she was deposed by a jealous Harry Craddock, who was relegated to the back service bar for his first five years at The Savoy. However, there is no evidence supporting the notion of Harry Craddock the villain, it may instead have been a change in the tides (and a little sexism). According to a study in 1905 quoted by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Coleman), “slightly less than half of the bartenders in London were women.” A respectable proportion in my mind, especially considering that only over the last decade or so have women started to make significant inroads back into the bar industry. So what happened? It seems, as usual, that American Prohibition may have been the root cause. Prohibition drove thirsty Americans to other countries to find their drink and according to Alice Lascelles (founding editor of Imbibe and the spirits and cocktails columnist for The Times), it may have been that “Americans, unlike the British, found the notion of female bartenders troubling.” Perhaps The Savoy was simply trying to rebrand or cater to new clientele. Or maybe part of the reason was a 50-year old Ada Coleman was simply tired of shaking drinks, having spent 25 years behind the bar and having served, by her own report, “one hundred thousand customers and poured one million drinks.” In either case, she undoubtedly had a formative role in creating the cocktails culture we know and enjoy today, though she may not have been fully appreciated or immortalized in printed literature. Regardless, let us appreciate the cocktail she is known for, the Hanky Panky.
