**Not Cocktail of the Week #62: Champs Élysées**  
You might think it’s weird for me to be writing an arguably French-themed cocktail with St. Patrick’s Day next Monday and truthfully it is because I forgot. That said, furthering the stereotype of the drunken Irishman seems silly, but if you need rationalization to make this week’s drink, it does use green Chartreuse, the most vividly green liqueur. It’s been a little while since the last NCotW with Chartreuse and while I hadn’t enjoyed this cocktail in the past, as it is oft-recommended I figured I was overdue for revisiting it and ended up loving it enough to share with all of you.

**Background**  
The Champs Élysées cocktail first shows up in *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, named after the famed avenue in Paris and using two very French ingredients, Cognac and Chartreuse. The history of the Champs Élysées is surprisingly non-existent, with none of my resources turning up anything substantial as to who concocted or how and why this cocktail came into being. If anyone else can turn up anything, I would really love to know more. It seems that this may have been a classic cocktail that was rediscovered by Murray Stenson, like the Last Word, and became popularized recently by the craft cocktail revival.

**Results**  
I went through a lot of Cognac/brandy testing the many different versions of the Champs Élysées because, while I hadn’t enjoyed it in the past, I felt that it was something worth exploring to find a version that suited my tastes. I first started with my best approximation of the recipe in *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, electing to use yellow Chartreuse for the unspecified “Chartreuse” in the recipe. I did a 3:1:1 ratio of Cognac, yellow Chartreuse, “sweetened lemon juice”, using a 2:1 ratio of lemon juice to simple syrup (which in retrospect may have been better at a 1:1 mixture of lemon juice to sugar…I should try that). This version was surprisingly light on the tongue at first, but after the initial airiness, comes in with fruit notes from Cognac, transitioning to the herbal notes of yellow Chartreuse, and a tart note of lemon near the end with a dry bitterness. I thought this version was a bit thin, needed more of the unique Chartreuse profile, and could stand to have a bit more sweetness (which may stem from my approximation of “sweetened lemon juice”.  
I then elected to try the recipe from the *Bartender’s Choice* app, which I’ve generally found pleasing to my palate. I was already running low on my Cognac, so I picked up a bottle of Paul Masson VSOP brandy, which I’ve seen recommended a few times on /r/cocktails as an amazing brandy for its price, most recently by /u/bitcheslovebanjos. I actually started to enjoy the Champs Élysées with this version, finding this one to be better balanced with a great texture and mouthfeel, though perhaps a little too sweet. It has a nose primarily of lemon and the fruity notes of Cognac, with a hint of some herbalness at the end. Similar to the previous attempt, this version started off pretty light on the palate, with a nice balance of sweet and sour combining with the Cognac before transitioning again near the end to the stronger herbal profile of green Chartreuse. With more Angostura bitters, it also has a light spice on the finish. Inspired by this version, I used this recipe to make a Champs Élysées with yellow Chartreuse, but cut the simple syrup to 0.25 oz to account for the sweeter yellow Chartreuse and to try and drop the sweetness a bit. This actually turned out to be really close to the recipe I tried from *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, but with an additional 0.25 oz lemon juice. I was surprised at how big a difference this made, not so much in the nose which was still primarily lemon and fruit, but the initial light and thin flavor of the cocktail was replaced by part of the herbal profile of yellow Chartreuse. This then went through the progression of flavors I was rapidly becoming familiar with, a balanced sweet and sour note, the fruity Cognac notes, the herbal and bitter notes of yellow Chartreuse, and finishing with a hint of spice from the Angostura bitters. Between these two versions, I found this one a bit milder on the finish and perhaps a bit fruitier, probably leaning towards the modified yellow Chartreuse version as the one I enjoyed more.  
At this point I thought it would be nice to try something a bit different, so I made the more spirit-forward green Chartreuse version that served to reintroduce this cocktail to the modern era from Murray Stenson of Zig Zag Café. This was significantly different from the previous versions and was immediately apparent by the herbal notes of Chartreuse asserting themselves in the nose much more. While this version lacks the zingy punch of sweet and sour, it allows for a balanced interplay between Cognac/brandy and Chartreuse. At first you get the herbal and sweet flavor of Chartreuse, which transitions into the secondary notes of fruit and oak from Cognac. Before the Chartreuse returns for the finish, there is a brief zing of lemon across the tongue, providing a nice counterpoint in between. With much less sugar, this version has a relatively dry finish of bitter spice and like the Last Word that Zig Zag Café was also famed for, their Champs Élysées is a very Chartreuse-forward cocktail.  
Still wanting more, I did one last version following the recipe from *The PDT Cocktail Book*, but using yellow Chartreuse as I thought its similarity to the recipe from *Bartender’s Choice*, but with a bit more Cognac, would potentially be even more enjoyable. I think I concluded this version was my favorite, starting with its intoxicating and very balanced aroma of lemon, honey, fruit and herbs. It had a moderate mouthfeel and had a slightly different progression but still familiar progression of flavors from the faint herbal Chartreuse note, followed first by sweet honey and lemon before the Cognac comes in, and finishing with the usual combination of herbs and spice. If you’ve read this far, I would encourage you to start with the PDT version first and depending on whether you like things a bit more dry or more sweet/sour, to go with Murray Stenson’s or the Bartender’s Choice version, respectively.

**Chartreuse**  
Learn more about green Chartreuse in my NCotW post on the [Final Ward](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1d3j41/not_cocktail_of_the_week_16_final_ward/) and about yellow Chartreuse in the [Widow’s Kiss](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1toslc/not_cocktail_of_the_week_51_widows_kiss/). While you’re there, maybe you should give those great cocktails a try! 

**Cheers!**  
Whew, those were some long tasting notes. I can’t believe I went through five versions of the Champs Élysées in figuring out how I like them, but ultimately the experience and education is always worth it, especially since I can share it with the rest of you. If you have some Chartreuse in your cabinet, give this one a try, it’s definitely worth it. As always, I look forward to your feedback and comments below. I won’t be posting the NCotW next week as /u/bitcheslovebanjos has a great cocktail to share so look forward to that. If you have any cocktail near and dear to your heart that you want to share with everybody through this column, drop me a line. I’m always happy to allow others to contribute to this endeavor especially since it allows me time to explore new cocktails for future posts. Thanks for reading and cheers!
