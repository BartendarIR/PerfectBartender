**Not Cocktail of the Week #63: Remember the Maine**

Welcome to this week’s Not Cocktail of the Week, I completely did not realize that Monday was St. Patrick’s Day; therefore this week’s cocktail is neither green nor does it use anything Irish. However, it does use a little of the green fairy, I hope that will suffice and allow you to enjoy this write up on the Remember the Maine cocktail. This cocktail is a current favorite of mine, largely due to the fact that my home bar has been void of Cherry Heering until recently. 

**Background**

I feel like the Remember the Maine cocktail is perhaps one of the more recognized cocktails from Charles H. Baker’s Gentleman’s Companion. I’ve seen it on many cocktail menu’s in my area which is surprising, considering I don’t live anywhere near the east or west coasts. For more information on Baker check out my previous NCotW post on the [Astor Hotel Special](http://redd.it/1uqnsq). The Remember the Maine cocktail came about in 1933 while Charles Baker was vacationing in Cuba, during coup, and staying in the very hotel where the persons being overthrown were staying. In 1933 Fulgenico Batista led a coup to overthrow the higher-ranking Cuban Army Officers in Havana. Many of these higher-ranking officers stayed where Baker was staying, the Hotel Nacional. Truly Baker loved adventure and disregarded dangerous situations. His spirit of adventure led to many adventurous spirits. Concerning this cocktail Baker wrote:

>REMEMBER the MAINE, a Hazy Memory of a Night in Havana during the Unpleasantnesses of 1933, when Each Swallow Was Punctuated with Bombs Going off on the Prado, or the Sound of 3″ Shells Being Fired at the Hotel NACIONAL, then Haven for Certain Anti-Revolutionary Officers. 

However, these events have little to do with the cocktail’s name. In 1898 the USS Maine, while in the Havana Harbor, unexpectedly exploded. Sinking to the bottom of the ocean and claiming the lives of over 260 men. What caused the explosion is still a mystery; some evidence points to a naval mine and other evidence to an internal explosion. The actual cause is still debated and has led to many conspiracy theories. The phrase “*Remember the Maine, the Hell with Spain!*” was popularized by the American media at the time, and became a rally cry throughout the coming Spanish-American War. The sinking was gasoline on the media frenzy fire concerning Cuba, and the war began shortly after the incident. It is no doubt that the violence from the Spanish-American War was engrained in Baker even though he was just a child during the war. However with the unfolding violence around him, the war’s catch phrase lived on in his memory and his drink. Much to our benefit Baker lived to tell the tale his fateful night in Havana.

**Results**

Unlike quite a few drinks from Baker’s books, this cocktail needs no tweaking for the modern palate. I find the original recipe quite adequate and enjoyable. I do enjoy the PDT recipe as the ratio of Cherry Heering to Absinthe decrease from 4:1 to 3:1, bringing more Absinthe into the mix, but this is a personal preference. This cocktail is a sweeter Manhattan variation with the addition of Cherry Heering, slightly offset by the herbal and floral elements of the Absinthe. I feel most modern cocktails featuring absinthe will rinse the glass then discard; the Remember the Maine cocktail really benefits from the addition of Absinthe, so please don’t rinse. To really even out the extra sweetness from the Cherry Heering, I would suggest using the most rugged and robust absinthe you have, if you have a variety to choose from.

This cocktail is what you would expect from a Manhattan variation, a marriage of fruit and spice from the vermouth and rye. Yet it feels like this happy couple takes the background to the kids, the small additions to this cocktail’s family, the Cherry Herring and Absinthe. Even though they are small additions, they have a large impact on the drink as a whole. The initial nose is strongly of cherry, with the vermouth coming in second here with dried fruit of plums, figs, and currants. I have to sadly admit my Dolin Rouge is nearing the end of its shelf life, which I find sharpens its flavor substantially, and not necessarily in a good way. However, for the Texas readers, HEB grocery stores have started carrying 375ml bottles of both Dolin Rouge and Blanc.

For the rye, I chose to feature Templeton instead of Rittenhouse, as I found the dryness of Templeton works exceptionally well with the additional sweetness of the Cherry Heering. While still a great choice, the spiciness of Rittenhouse seems to fight with the intense flavor from the Absinthe. The flavor of this cocktail really comes out as sweet cherry rye, where the anise yields to the other herbal notes of the absinthe. I used my Delaware Phoenix Blues Cat Absinthe, which is a lovely fennel forward yet balanced artisan Absinthe from New York. The Absinthe comes through after the cherry and rye, and lingers shortly on the syrupy finish with sweet fennel and anise.

As for garnish, I chose to forgo the lemon twist and go with a homemade brandied maraschino cherry. Mainly because I have so many jars and my wife is getting tired of them taking up space. However, while making these cherries I added numerous spices including anise, a key part of Absinthe. Since this cocktail features Cherry Heering and Absinthe, the addition worked very well. I’m sure a Luxardo cherry would offer an equally enjoyable experience. However I did miss the lemon notes on the nose. Perhaps a flamed lemon peel with a cherry would be the way to go.
