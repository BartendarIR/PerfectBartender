**Not Cocktail of the Week #30: Southside and Southern Exposure**  
And now back to your regularly scheduled NCotW programming after last week’s special cakeday feature. To make up for the distinct lack of a cocktail last week, I am presenting *two* closely related cocktails, the classic Southside cocktail and the Southern Exposure, a variation I enjoyed for my birthday at my usual cocktail bar, The Alembic. I’ve wanted to make a Southside ever since /u/LMoore916 ‘s [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1elgp4/a_staple_in_my_home_and_bar_the_southside_with/) and after finally acquiring some mint (and hopefully growing more of my own since my sprigs are showing roots), I was able to a few weeks ago.

**Background**  
The Southside cocktail is another classic cocktail that existed pre-Prohibition and was delicious enough to continue being enjoyed even today. In my research, I came across three origin stories for the Southside, ranging from the fantastical to the mundane. Let’s start with the most pedestrian and ramp up the excitement from there.  
One of the supposed origins of the Southside is claimed by the famed 21 Club in New York City, originally a speakeasy during Prohibition known as “Jack and Charlie’s”, that continues to serve this delicious cocktail. However, as this cocktail predates Prohibition, it seems unlikely that they can claim the origins of the Southside.  
The most likely story is proposed by Eric Felten, writer of the “Postmodern Times” culture column in the Wall Street Journal, claiming that the Southside originated from the Southside Sportsmen’s Club in Long Island, New York. Initially existing as Snedecor’s Tavern in 1820, the members of this “sporting fraternity” (see my brief article on Jerry Thomas in the [Improved Whiskey Cocktail](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1hkxy5/not_cocktail_of_the_week_26_improved_whiskey/)) eventually grew too numerous and so they built a new clubhouse in 1866. In 1886, the “South Side Sportsmen’s Club of Long Island” was established, gathering in this building for “social intercourse” until the 1960s. The building currently serves as a meeting place for the Vanderbilt Historical Society, as William K. Vanderbilt was counted among their members. In any case, this club was notable for its Mint Juleps, which Mr. Felten proposes led to the evolution and creation of other mint-centric cocktails such as the Southside. Given the popularity of this cocktail on the East Coast, particularly in the Hamptons and the well-to-do, this seems to me to be a very plausible theory.  
The most exciting and memorable story comes not from New York, but instead from Chicago during Prohibition. At this time, the city lay divided between the Dion O’Banion’s Northside gang, which thanks to geographical location had a much more palatable selection of spirits smuggled from Canada, and Frankie McErlane’s Southside gang (affiliated with the famed Johnny Torrio and Al Capone). As the Southside gang only had access to “local spirits” aka “bathtub gin”, Joseph Saltis, one of the bootleggers in the Southside gang, came up with the idea of making their product more palatable by mixing it with sugar, citrus, and mint. As legendary this story would be as the origin of the Southside cocktail, it fails in multiple regards, namely that it is unlikely that this cocktail would A) become popular enough in the short period of time between Prohibition and the publication of the *Savoy Cocktail Book*, B) overcome the prejudice being a cocktail comprised of the lowest of spirits, “bathtub gin”, and transform into one enjoyed by the upper crust of society, and C) miraculously travel to and became popular on the East Coast.  
Regardless of its origins, the fact that it has many speaks to its deliciousness and why this simple and classic cocktail it continues to be enjoyed today.

**Results**  
It’s interesting to see how the Southside seems to shift from calling for lemon juice to lime juice, understandably so since gin goes so well with lime, but I elected to go with the classic recipe using lemon juice and adapted for modern palates in the *PDT Cocktail Book*. This cocktail has a very pleasing fresh aroma, smelling of mint and lemon, which I associate with cleanliness for some reason. The muddled mint combines with gin initially giving this cocktail a light vegetal aspect on the palate, but transitions into the familiar sweet and sour of sugar and lemon juice. The mint also provides a light cooling effect on the finish, but personally I could see myself using even more mint. This cocktail is definitely cool and refreshing, which surely contributed to its long-lasting popularity, especially in the hot and humid summers of the East Coast.  

**Southern Exposure**  
*Background*  
This delicious cocktail comes to us by way of Daniel Hyatt, bar manager at San Francisco’s *[Alembic Bar](http://www.alembicbar.com)*, and will serve as the usual “Variations” section this week as it is based on the classic Southside cocktail. I have to admit I was initially a bit apprehensive about ordering this seemingly strange concoction described as: 
> another refreshing elixir plucked straight from the garden, our spin on the classic southside uses st. george terroir gin, fresh mint, lime juice, a touch of sugar and a little shot of fresh celery juice. loaded with antioxidants to help deal with the haight’s population of free "radicals". 

Celery juice is not something I am used to encountering in a cocktail, but after tasting this one, I knew I had to figure out how to make it and then share it with the rest of you.  

*Recipe*  
* 1 large celery rib  (or enough to prepare 0.75 oz celery juice)  
* 1.5 oz gin (Junipero or St. George recommended)  
* 0.5 oz simple syrup (1:1)  
* 0.5 oz lime juice  
* Handful mint leaves and sprig for garnish  
Finely grate celery rib and squeeze over a strainer to extract juice. Add all ingredients to shaker, fill with ice, and shake. Fine strain into glass, garnish with a small mint sprig.  
A note on preparing celery juice: The first time I prepared the celery for this cocktail I used a normal box grater and ended up needing closer to one and a half ribs of celery for the 0.75 oz celery juice called for. The second time around I tried a microplane grater, which yielded a *lot* more juice, as I got a solid 1.5 oz from a single rib (and thus two cocktails). If you use a tea strainer in a similar style as mine, do not simply push on it to extract juice as you will likely push the mesh out of your strainer and ruin it. Make sure to support the mesh from the other side.

*Results*  
At first glance, the Southern Exposure has a striking and intense green color. This drink carries the signature nose of mint with a vegetal note from the celery juice. The celery adds a unique savory element to the drink and really tames the usual bracing tartness of lime juice. The flavor is initially a very smooth combination of the herbal backbone from gin and fresh celery flavor. These are followed up by a slight sweet and sour middle, finishing with a strong vegetal and slight spicy note. The celery juice really adds a unique element to this cocktail, giving it a full texture and weighty body while also melding the classic combination of gin, lime, and simple syrup into something magical. 

**Cheers!**  
Given the relative simplicity of these cocktails, I’m looking forward to hearing about your results making either one of these cocktails. Hopefully you’ve enjoyed the double feature this week, I’m glad to be returning the familiar format for this week’s column and especially enjoyed sharing a unique cocktail that I had recently. As usual, your suggestions, questions, and comments are all appreciated. If you’re interested in sharing a special cocktail you especially enjoy, feel free to contact me and I’m sure we can arrange a convenient time for an NCotW guest post. As usual dear readers, until next week, cheers!  
PS: If any of you have the opportunity to visit San Francisco and want to grab a cocktail with me, send me a PM, I'm always more than happy to find an excuse to walk over and drink at The Alembic.
