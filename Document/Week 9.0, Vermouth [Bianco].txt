Thanks to /u/hebug for letting me do this week's NCotW. I'm going to write about my favorite cocktail, the Greenpoint, a variation of the classical Brooklyn cocktail. I have dicovered that amazing cocktail at the ACME bar in Berkeley, during my last trip to San Francisco. It was also the Greenpoint which got myself into the craft of cocktail mixing. Since in Germany where I live, our cocktail culture is a little different and the only way to get a decent cocktail is to do it yourself.

**Background**  
The Brooklyn cocktail might have become as popular as the Manhattan, if Amer Picon, a french orange-flavored apertif bitter, would have been available in the United States. So in 2004 Vincenzo Errico, a bartender at Milk & Honey in New York, created the Red Hook, a variation of the pre-prohibition Brooklyn cocktail. He replaced the dry vermouth and Amer Picon used in the Brooklyn with Punt e Mes, a sweet and bitter vermouth. The bitterness in Punt e Mes is similiar to the taste of Amer Picon. So the Red Hook is like a more sweet and less dry version of the Brooklyn. The Red Hook was that popular, that Michael McIlroy also from Milk & Honey, created another variation, the Greenpoint. The Greenpoint uses sweet vermouth as well, but also substitutes the maraschino liqueur with Chartreuse, resulting into a little more herbal taste. After that, more bartenders at Milk & Honey and other bars started to create their own Brooklyn variations, including the Bensonhurst, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens and Carroll Gardens. Each variation was named after a neigborhood in Brooklyn. Most of them are the attempts to substitute Amer Picon in the original Brooklyn recipe. So would Amer Picon have been available in the United States, we probably wouldn't have gotton all those great variations of the Brooklyn.

**Recipes**  
*The best known Greenpoint recipe*  
* 2 oz rye whiskey  
* 0.5 oz yellow Chartreuse  
* 0.5 oz sweet vermouth (like Punt e Mes)  
* 1 dash Angostura bitters (optional, see notes below)  
* 1 dash orange bitters (optional, see notes below)  
Stir with ice and strain into chilled cocktail glass

This is the recipe of the Greenpoint you find on most cocktail websites and blogs. Sometimes, especially when the recipe explicitly calls for Punt e Mes, the bitters are omitted, because of Punt e Mes has already a rather bitter taste. However it seems that Punt e Mes is the generally preferred vermouth for the Greenpoint. But the dry and bitter finish of Punt e Mes don't go well with the sweet herbal taste of Chartreuse which kicks in at the same time. The guys from PDT have recognized that problem and solved it by doubling the amount of vermouth and reducing the amount of Chartreuse, putting the vermouth more into the foreground.

*PDT Cocktail Book*  
* 2 oz Rittenhouse Bonded Rye Whiskey  
* 1 oz Punt e Mes  
* 1 barspoon yellow Chartreuse  
* 1 dash Angostura bitters  
Stir with ice and strain into chilled cocktail glass

However instead of reducing the ratio of Chartreuse in favor of the vermouth, I prefer to use a bianco vermouth, which is more subtle and goes pretty well with Chartreuse. That way you can keep the nice herbal taste of Chartreuse at its full scale. And the combination of Angostura and orange bitters, add a complex but more subtle bitterness than Punt e Mes does.

*My preferred Greenpoint*  
* 2 oz Russell's Reserve Rye  
* 0.5 oz yellow Chartreuse  
* 0.5 oz bianco vermouth  
* 1 dash Angostura bitters  
* 1 dash orange bitters  
Stir with ice and strain into chilled cocktail glass

**Results**  
When I made the Greenpoint from the PDT cocktail book, I didn't had Rittenhouse. So I used Templeton instead. However, in this Greenpoint the vermouth is clearly in the foreground, and goes well with the Chartreuse, but its hard to taste the Chartreuse at all. And I found it a little much too bitter. So you might want to omit the dash of Angostura, since Punt e Mes is already bitter enough. Or you might try to go with a less bitter vermouth like Carpano Antica together with a dash Angostura and orange bitters.

The Greenpoint with Russell's Reserve Rye and bianco vermouth, starts with a soft sweetness from the bianco vermouth. Quickly the woody spice of the Russell's Reserve Rye kicks in, followed by a pleasant herbal taste of Chartreuse. You can clearly taste each ingredient after each other, making it a truly rich and complex cocktail, even though I'm having a hard time calling it a Brooklyn variation.

**Cheers!**
