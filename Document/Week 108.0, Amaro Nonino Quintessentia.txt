**Not Cocktail of the Week #108: Paper Plane**

Well, this week it is my rare honor to fill in for /u/hebug and try to give something back to the series that’s given so much (drunkenness and cocktail envy) to me. This is a cocktail (or ‘mixed drink’ as my mentor [Andrew Willett](http://www.elementalmixology.com/) would say) that is almost always mentioned when people discuss the ‘Modern Classics’. That moniker is earned, in my view, because it really is a a new ‘type’ of cocktail that ventures outside of standard cocktail forms (sour, juelp, etc.) and uses two types of amari to sweeten and add complexity to a base of whiskey and lemon.

You might be tempted to think of it as a variation of a sour, but the ratios are such (equal proportions of all ingredients) that it really suggests a new category of cocktail.

**Background** 

The Paper Plane was created like so many other ‘Modern Classics’ by legendary Milk & Honey bartender Sam Ross while he was listening to [Paper Planes by M.I.A.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewRjZoRtu0Y). 

Ross is probably the closest thing the current cocktail community has to a [Jerry Thomas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Thomas_%28bartender%29). An Australian by birth, Ross worked in bars—either as a barista or bartender—since he was 15 years old, then moved to New York City and worked at both the Pegu Club and Little Branch as well as Milk & Honey.

The Paper Plane is actually sort of like the song it is named after in a few respects. The song itself is a mash-up of some unlikely (or possibly inevitable) complex musical elements—spanning old world and new. Similarly, the cocktail is a mix between old and new world factors as well: the ancient old-world lemon, the early 20th century orange/rhubarb Aperol, the late 20th century Amaro Nonino Quintessentia and the new world Kentucky Bourbon. Because of the double amari, the complexity of this drink is outstanding with the addition of lemon and bourbon, it’s both balanced and refreshing.

**Variations** 

While the Paper Plane is rightly considered a modern classic, fans of more challenging tastes like to replace the Aperol with Campari and make—what has been come to be known as a—‘Paper Airplane’. It always strikes me as odd that people compare the tastes of Aperol and Campari, and replace them for each other in cocktails. While they are definitely ‘old stand-by’ type amari, both widely available and delicious, they are really nothing alike. Aperol has a strong orange-y, rhubarb-y (or at least fruity) taste, is lighter in alcohol content and can be thought of as an ingredient that is, to some extent, a complex orange syrup. Campari on the other hand is an almost impossible-to-describe bittersweet and lovely amaro, with tremendous complexity, but almost no forward orange notes.

At my short lived, [Styx-themed Speakeasy](https://instagram.com/paradisetheatre/) in Los Angeles, we never had Amaro Nonino and were also in love with Amaro CioCiaro. This resulted in the development, with a Dallas cocktail queen (who is now running her own speakeasy “The Velvet Number”) of a different style of Paper Plane (very similar in most respects) using CioCiaro and a little bit of [Miracle Mile](https://www.facebook.com/miraclemilebitters) Forbidden Bitters. In the LA Cocktail scene, Miracle Mile Bitters is the gold standard and, in my view, rightly so. Just for this post I had my partner in crime (literally, as, I do believe it’s massively illegal to have a bar in your house) /u/joyous_cock send me some MM Bitters to use in this cocktail. My favorite for inclusion (2 shakes) is the Gingerbread Bitters, but my bottle ran out a year ago and it is no longer available. For my variation, I used the outstanding ‘Forbidden Bitters’ which is a take on a classic 'aromatic' bitters with cardamom notes that make it cut through cocktails in a way that is both subtle and outstanding.

**Results** 

*Sam Ross Original:* [Not unlike NCotW #107](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2vkgdm/not_cocktail_of_the_week_107_latin_quarter/), I had first understood this cocktail to be from the Violet Hour (a fantastic bar in Chicago), however after learning that it was, in fact, Sam Ross who’d created this masterpiece I was not surprised at all. This cocktail is—if you are used to the old forms (sour, julep, old-fashioned, etc.)—surprising at first. It is both refreshing and complex at the same time. It is light and citrusy, but also slightly bitter and full of complexities from both amari. After a good shake, it comes out a gorgeous salmon color that hints at its almost ruby grapefruit taste. 

Still there’s no great way to describe how a well-made Paper Plane so perfectly hits the ‘bliss point’ by balancing sweet, sour and bitter in a refreshing and surprising drink. I think of it as a true classic. I served it at a party with mostly older, rural, South Carolinians recently and they were all floored.

*The Paper Airplane:* While I understand the urge to compare Campari and Aperol, I can’t see any real connection between them other than being widely available (in North America) amari. This arbitarity in comparison bears out for me in the replacement of one with another in the drink. Okay, so we’ve added Campari. Does it taste better? Worse? Hmmm. It’s hard to say. It tastes more like Campari and, while that isn’t a bad thing, it doesn’t taste nearly as ‘definitive’ as the original. It tastes, to me, like a cocktail with Campari shoe-horned into it because Campari has some mythical appeal and not because it truly belongs. The Campari, in my view, overpowers the Amaro Nonino and, as such, produces a less complex, less-interesting cocktail.

*Paradise Theatre Variation:* Because our friend Angela got us obsessed with Amaro CioCiaro (and it costs about a third of what Amaro Nonino does), we got interested in a way to make a Paper Plane variation that included it. As such, I find this much, much more satisfying than the Paper Airplane. The star in the Paper Plane is the double-amari, Aperol deliciousness. Taking the Aperol out makes it feel like a completely different cocktail. However, this cocktail takes the rich sweet complexity of Amaro CioCiaro and adds it in for a subordinate role with the Aperol. The results, to my palate (and to the palate of A/B testers) are really outstanding. The subtle addition of the excellent Miracle Mile bitters also does something wonderful for this mix as well. While the original ‘Paper Plane’ is ‘light’, this version is more ‘rich’ and deep. Both are amazing in my view.


**Cheers!**

I hope, no matter which version suits you, you try this style of cocktail. It occupies a position that, prior to the double-amari cocktails’ invention, was simply nonexistent. Unlike many cocktails of the first golden age, the focus here is on balance, drinkability, complexity and lightness. It’s hard to describe almost anything that way, but this cocktail seems to really manage all of those things well. 


It’s perhaps best in the summer as a refreshing, but dry, all-purpose cocktail. However, here in the unusually frigid temperatures of South Carolina, it does quite well. I’ve seen this cocktail stun novices and veterans alike. It truly is a modern classic. Cheers to Sam Ross. Cheers to /u/hebug. Thanks for letting me ramble.
