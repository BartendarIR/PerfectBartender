**Not Cocktail of the Week #87: Queen’s Park Swizzle & 151 Swizzle**  
Thanks to /u/gregbenson314 for his post last week on the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club, the break halfway through NCotW Tiki Edition let me get a head start on the last two Tiki cocktails. This week’s cocktail was originally going to be the Queen’s Park Swizzle, a simple cocktail which would allow me to revisit Demerara rum after the post on the [Bumbo & Rum Manhattan](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/27wec2/not_cocktail_of_the_week_75_bumbo_rum_manhattan/), but after I stumbled across the coveted Lemon Hart 151 overproof Demerara rum, I wanted to make and present the 151 Swizzle as well, so you get a special double feature this week. If you have a nice Demerara rum on hand or have lucked into a bottle of Lemon Hart 151, skip ahead to the appropriate recipe, mix one up, then sit back and enjoy it while reading.

***Queen’s Park Swizzle***  
**Background**  
The Queen’s Park Swizzle claims its origins as an adaptation of the general Caribbean swizzle from the Queen’s Park Hotel in the 1920s. The Queen’s Park Hotel, built in 1893, was a luxurious resort for wealthy Brits vacationing in Trinidad, equipped with all the latest modern amenities including electricity. While the hotel was torn down a decade or so ago, their signature house cocktail cemented its place in history. Trader Vic was particularly enamored of this cocktail, quoted in 1946 as calling it “the most delightful form of anesthesia given out today.” Though the term swizzle as a drink predates the Queen’s Park Swizzle, Martin Cate (owner of Smuggler’s Cove and a very well-respected figure in the modern Tiki revival) considers it to be the ancestral swizzle drink that begat the swizzle family as we know today as it was the first to include the citrus juice now common to all modern swizzles.

**Results**  
This cocktail is ridiculously delicious and incredibly quaffable. I’m already a huge fan of Demerara rum and while making this drink is lot of work, it is another amazing way to showcase it. While I don’t own a proper swizzle stick ($20 for a single one on Cocktail Kingdom is too rich for my blood), I jury-rigged a serviceable alternative using the back of my barspoon and a skewer I cut down to fit my Collins glass. It worked reasonably well, but the skewer didn’t stay as well as I would’ve liked. Perhaps next time I will try to improve it by cutting some slight notches in the skewer for a tighter fight.  
I first tasted the version at Smuggler’s Cove finding a very lush vegetal mint nose with the cocktail itself very cold and crisp with mint and sugar being the dominant notes, sour lime keeping the palate fresh, and rum a bit more in the background appearing near the finish. They also finish it with a napkin rolled up and neatly tied around the middle of the drink which works wonders in keeping the condensation from getting out of hand, so if you have the means to do the same, it is a really clever touch.  
Recreating it at home where I can better focus on tasting, I found that with the generous amount of crushed ice (but equally generous amount of tasty Demerara rum), the nose from the cocktail itself is relatively muted, carrying only the notes derived from the garnishes, which give it a refreshing mint and a bit of spice from the Angostura bitters dashed atop it. Sipping it is where the magic happens though, with a marvelous balance of sweetness up front, mingling with a mild tart lime note and a very crisp herbal mint body, finishing with the rich smoky sugariness of Demerara rum and a lingering spiced bitter finish. Much like a [Mint Julep](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/24d68i/not_cocktail_of_the_week_69_mint_julep/), the combination of crushed ice and mint give it an invigoratingly cool element and I daresay makes it an equal to that venerated American classic. Give it a try and you may also be inclined to agree. I, for one, agree with Trader Vic’s sentiment that the Queen’s Park Swizzle is a delightful form of anesthesia and found that 3 oz of Demerara rum disappeared frighteningly fast.

***151 Swizzle***  
**Background**  
The 151 Swizzle was published in *Beachbum Berry’s Grog Log* by Jeff “Beachbum” Berry in 1998. He credits it a bartender at Don the Beachcomber’s in Hollywood named Tony Ramos, who was serving it in the 1960s. I was able to uncover little else about the background of this cocktail, but if anyone knows more, please share.  

**Recipes**  
*Beachbum Berry Remixed*, Jeff Berry, 2010  
via *Beachbum Berry’s Grog Log*, 1998  
* 1.5 oz 151-proof Demerara rum (Lemon Hart or El Dorado) [I would argue Lemon Hart is really the only choice]  
* 0.5 oz fresh lime juice  
* 0.5 oz sugar syrup  
* 1 dash Angostura bitters  
* 6 drops (1/8 tsp) Pernod  
* 8 oz (1 cup) crushed ice  
* Fresh nutmeg  
Put everything – except nutmeg – in a blender. Blend at high speed for 5 seconds. Pour unstrained into a metal cup with a flared top (pictured) or a pilsner glass, adding more crushed ice to fill. Dust with nutmeg. Garnish with a cinnamon stick.

**Results**  
Stumbling across the venerated Lemon Hart 151 when production of it is currently on hold was very exciting and since I’ve never had an overproof Demerara rum before, I wanted to start myself with some simple cocktails to better understand its unique flavor profile. The 151 Swizzle was the first that came to mind, which was followed shortly after (the next day) with a Kapu Kai, Jeff “Beachbum” Berry’s original version of a classic Daiquiri using Lemon Hart 151. Disclaimer: 1.5 oz of 151-proof rum is nearly twice as strong as an equivalent measure of 80-proof spirit and 40% stronger than a 2.0 oz pour. Imbibe with moderation as Lemon Hart 151 goes down a lot smoother than you would expect and this cocktail does an amazing job of hiding its strength.  
The 151 Swizzle, much like the Queen’s Park Swizzle, is topped with a generous amount of crushed ice, which masks most of the rum aroma, compensating with the cinnamon and fresh nutmeg garnishes which give it a pleasantly spicy nose with a faint hint of dark Demerara sugar. Sipping it through the straw, it is very cold and crisp with the strong smoky Demerara sugar note of Lemon Hart on full display in contrast with a tart lime note that persists in the background throughout. Interestingly, my wife described the combination of tart lime and Demerara sugar as reminiscent of dark red cherries. There was a lingering burnt sugar bitterness on the palate, but I found this cocktail to be simple and very refreshing. Hand crushing 8 oz of ice is no small task, but for a drink like this it’s worth it.  

**Variations**  
In terms of variations, there are many other swizzles, but the one that jumps to my mind is the 2070 Swizzle, cleverly named for its use of Angostura 1919 and Lemon Hart 151 rum (1919 + 151 = 2070), from Martin Cate, owner of Smuggler’s Cove. [Here](http://www.slammie.com/atomicgrog/blog/2013/09/13/take-5-martin-cate-owner-of-smugglers-cove-in-san-francisco-and-rum-cocktail-maestro/) is an interview with the man himself and a recipe for the 2070 Swizzle if you are interested.
