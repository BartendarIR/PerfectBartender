**Introduction**

Welcome to the first entry of the second year of Not Cocktail of the Week; although it will be quite difficult to follow up on last weeks amazing post on the Old Fashioned, I will try my best to introduce to you a cocktail that has truely fallen through the cracks. While /u/hebug is enjoying his vacation, he graciously allowed me to write up this weeks Not Cocktail of the Week on The Astor Hotel Special. I discovered this cocktail after acquired a copy of Charles H. Baker’s *The Gentleman’s Companion, Being an Exotic Drinking Book or, Around the World With Jigger, Beaker and Flask*. Charles Baker lived one of those lives that we all should be slightly envious of. He gallivanted around the world - multiple times - venturing to many fine establishments eating and drinking with many exciting people of the time, including William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Errol Flynn, and Robert Frost. The most interesting aspect of the Astor Hotel Special is it’s evolution from 1926 to the 21st century.



**Background**

One of my favorite aspects of this cocktail is its history; in fact the Astor Hotel Special’s history is more enjoyable than the cocktail in its original form. Charles was born in 1895 in Florida, and held such jobs as an abrasives salesman, magazine editor, and interior designer. After he came into money from his grandparents in 1925 and his adventurous spirit was born. It is from this spirit that he then began one of many trips around the world. Recording recipes for various foods and drinks from all over the globe, Baker compiled various culinary volumes. These books are more than cocktail recipes, but a travelogue of his adventures and the drinks that inspired them.

Like almost all recipes in *The Gentleman’s Companion*, they consist of part cocktail concoctions and part anecdotes and the Astor Hotel Special is no exception. Charles Baker who had recently made a substantial amount of money in the stock market, set out on his first of many trips around the world. His “epidemic of missing steamboats” due to imbibing his creations began in Shanghai with the Astor Hotel Special. The Astor House Hotel was the first western style hotel in China, and became a favorite establishment of Bakers. Imaging 1920’s Shanghai, with this elegant hotel resting near the union of the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek, Baker inside doing what he does best, all while a fog is setting in. Baker having ingested a number of these cocktails had completely forgotten his departing steamboat, along with all of his belongings, which were now on their way to Hong Kong. But the story does not end there. During his being marooned there in Shanghai, he shared this cocktail and romance with a young maiden. Who he writes, quite bitterly, would later reject his marriage proposal for the company of another gentleman who’s only claim to fame was that he was kidnaped by Alvin “Creepy” Karpis, a notorious gangster from the Ma Barker gang, who would later serve the longest time within the walls of Alcatraz. 

From the barroom of the Astor House Hotel to *The Gentleman’s Companion*, the Astor Hotel Special all but disappears. Until the modern cocktail revival renews interest in a bon vivant chronicled worldwide cocktail adventure. The Astor Hotel Special was revived by the bartenders at Milk & Honey in New York City and featured in the Bartenders Choice App (which I’m sure many of you have).

**Results**

I have tried both versions of this cocktail and can whole-heartedly say that the Milk & Honey version is far superior to its original form. I feel this is a great example of the modern bartender’s ability to enhance a forgotten cocktail for a modern palate. The original cocktail is quite enjoyable until the absinthe is added. From the nose to the finish it is all about absinthe’s anise and fennel. As you drink the cocktail you can taste a slight tartness from the lemon. Surprising given that only 0.5 tsp is used. A whole 0.75 oz of absinthe almost completely overwhelms the lemon and maraschino, and largely dulls the cognac. This is surprising since, on the quantity of absinthe used in cocktails, Baker notes earlier on in his volume:
>“In mixed drinks absinthe has a flavouring value all its own. Usually a very small quantity should be used, as the taste is potent and will dull many other more delicate flavours.” 

However he seems to forget his advice here, resulting in a mess of cocktail. The color is an uninspiring brown, and the portion of egg whites fails to produce a luxurious foam or texture we have come to love in cocktails. It is no wonder this drink fell off the map until the bartenders of Milk & Honey picked it up and decided to revive it.
This is where the drink gets quite pleasant. The bartenders at Milk & Honey obviously rebuilt this cocktail from the ground up on the foundation of the traditional 2:1:1 Strong:Sweet:Sour ratio. The nose is a tart blend of lemon and the maraschino sharpness. With a simple absinthe rinse, the unique licorice flavor is present from the nose to tongue and always subtle. I can’t help but think that this is really what Baker envisioned of when he wrote about utilizing small amounts of absinthe in cocktails. This Astor Hotel Special from first sip has a silky texture from the egg whites and robust brandy taste, which pairs exceptionally well with the sharp maraschino flavor. The finish is reminiscent of lemon meringue, creamy and tart. I tried many ratios of Cognac:Lemon:Maraschino, and found that 2:3/4:3/4 is where this cocktail comes alive. A little less Lemon and Maraschino and it falls to the background all too easily, a little more and it overpowers the absinthe and cognac. It is obvious Milk & Honey took their time to bring this cocktail back to life.



**Cheers!**

I hope you have enjoyed reading this week’s NCotW and will have time to enjoy this interesting cocktail and remind you that the heart of the cocktail is all about the spirit of adventure and the people and places you enjoy them with. I feel this is an amazing example of a cocktail enthusiast taking a forgotten and rather unbalanced cocktail and reinventing it. I also hope this will inspire you to attempt to reinvent an overlooked cocktail. If you don’t have a copy of *The Gentleman’s Companion* yet, it has a well-deserved space on your shelf. It is by far the most unusual and entertaining cocktail book you will read. Although it contains some less than perfect recipes, it makes up for it in inspiration. Let me know if you have any other great stories about Charles H. Baker, or any other cocktails of his you love.

>“All really interesting people—sportsman, explorers, musicians, scientists, vagabonds and writers—were vitally interested in good things to eat and drink; cared for exotic and intriguing ways of composing them. We soon discovered further that this keen interest was not solely through gluttony, the spur of hunger or merely to sustain life, but in a spirit of high adventure.”
