As the creator of NCotW, I am taking the liberty of reformatting and resubmitting /u/gregbenson314 ‘s guest post for consistency’s sake. We had a bit of miscommunication in coordinating this week’s post and I didn’t provide as much guidance as I have in the past. Upvote/downvote this post at your pleasure, but at least give him an upvote on his [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2er809/ncotw_guest_post_royal_bermuda_yacht_club/) for his work. 

**History**  
The year is 1844.  The British Empire is arguably in its prime.  In the small island of Bermuda, Officers of the British Navy establish a private yacht club, where the richest of society could unwind after a hard day of enslaving other nations.  Prince Albert lent his name as patronage of the club in 1846, and thus the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club because synonymous with the Caribbean high class. It was probably this idea of refined cocktail parties that led Trader Vic to create the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club cocktail in 1946. Although never stated outright, it could be argued that the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club is simply a twist on the classic Daiquiri, but with the sweet element being Cointreau and falernum.  If you’re not familiar with falernum, /u/hebug did a very good write up on it in his NCotW on the [Chartreuse Swizzle](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/27bg7z/not_cocktail_of_the_week_74_chartreuse_swizzle/).

**Results**  
I opted for the PDT proportions, as I’ve had the best luck with them in the past.  Also, it more closely resembles the original way I learned the drink (at a former bar I used to work in).  I opted for Doorly’s 5 year old instead of the Mount Gay, simply because that’s my Bajan rum of choice at home. At first you get that distinctive rum kick, then the sweet and sour backbone comes through immediately. Incredibly similar to the Daiquiri at first, but then a very distinct banana note comes through either from the rum or falernum.  This is then followed by ginger and cloves from the falernum.  The sourness falls away to be left with the sweetness of the falernum and Cointreau.  The aftertaste is prominently orange, distinctly from the Cointreau. This cocktail has an incredibly thick mouthfeel.  A lot thicker than the Daiquiri, probably due to the two liqueurs present. This could almost be described as a more refined and held back Daiquiri, but a lot smoother, and tempering that feisty sharpness (which isn’t an inherently good or bad thing). If I had to personify this cocktail, I’d say it was like an elegant older family member of the Daiquiri. I can easily see why this would be the house cocktail of a Caribbean yachting club, as it is definitely on the easy drinking end of the spectrum.  Like the [Hotel Nacional](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2dgqc3/not_cocktail_of_the_week_84_tiki_edition_hotel/) before it, this is definitely a sweet cocktail, but not cloyingly so. 
Like many of the sours family, each person will have their perfect ratios for them.  So don’t be scared to play about with the ratios - after all it’s more fun that way!  

**Barbados Rum**  
Even though the cocktail is the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club, in most recipes, Barbados rum is specified, rather than its Bermudan counterpart.  I couldn’t find out much about this, but if I was to hazard a guess as to why, I’d say it’s probably due to some combination of availability of Bajan rum when the original recipes were created, and the “funkiness” that is typical of Bajan rums. Bajan rums are classed as British style. /u/hebug gave a very comprehensive run down on it in last week’s NCotW, so I’ll try not to repeat too much of it here! Whenever people ask me about rum, my first train of thought is always to who colonised the island first.  Early invaders and settlers would take traditions of spirit making from their homeland, and that would influence the style of rum being produced.  Spanish style rums would be heavily influenced by the brandy and sherry background of Spain.  This would then translate into those techniques being used for rum production as well.  An example of this is the solera ageing method where rums are constantly being moved along a chain of barrels in order to speed up the ageing process. Barbados was colonised by the Brits, and with it came the techniques of Scotch whisky production.  So, if anything, it should be called Scottish style rum!  The most typical characteristic of Scotch production that has leaked into rum production would be the common use of pot stills.  This leads to a lot “heavier”, and less refined spirit directly off the still.  However, this funkiness isn’t necessarily a bad thing: it may be personal preference for you to enjoy this style more!  
The first rum distillery on Barbados was Mount Gay- a familiar name to many in the rum world.  It’s unclear when the distillery first opened.  However, a deed from 1703 was found, so brand ambassadors often cite that as proof that mount gay is the oldest rum in the world.   To this day, Mount Gay is distilled through a series of 2 copper pot stills, from molasses.  This lends itself to a high proportion of esters- the flavour compounds that give the fruity notes such as bananas and peaches.  
Although Mount Gay is seen as the stereotypical Bajan rum, I’d recommend skipping their “eclipse” bottling and heading straight to the Extra Old.  Their 1703 is very good, and well worth the price, but I would never dream of mixing it! In the price range of the eclipse, I’d suggest Doorly’s XO.  There isn’t too much information available about them online, but the back of my bottle says they’ve been in production since 1908, and it was finished in sherry casks.  Regardless, this is a fantastic buy, and one you should look out for. Another honourable mention needs to go to Plantation.  They straddle that fine line between being a distiller, and an independent bottler.  Their Plantation Barbados 20 XO is absolutely phenomenal, although it is slightly too smooth to properly represent the “British style” of rum. Side Note: In the category (Of British style, but not necessarily Bajan), I recommend El Dorado, Pusser’s, Appleton’s, and English Harbour.

**Conclusion**  
I hope you’ve enjoyed this week’s NCotW post.  If anything, I hope it gives you yet *another* reason to get a bottle of falernum, if you don’t already have it on hand.  Better yet- make your own! I’m still looking for a great falernum recipe, so if you can point me in the right direction that would be greatly appreciated.
