**Not Cocktail of the Week #96: Toronto & Fernet Branca**  
My love affair with Fernet Branca started a couple years ago when I spent a summer in San Francisco for work. It took me a year to discover the Toronto and until I tried one, I thought Fernet would be far too assertive to use in a decent cocktail. The Toronto became one of my favorite cocktails and is part of the reason I gained such an interest in cocktails in general… After discovering it, I went to a local bar and asked for a Toronto. My mind was blown when the bartender proceeded to ask which way I would like it prepared, as there are a couple variations, and gave me a quick history of the drink. I realized that there was a lot more to this whole cocktail thing than I was aware, and was hooked from then on.

Since then I've also found the [Industry Sour](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2gony4/not_cocktail_of_the_week_89_industry_sour/), so now I have at least a couple Fernet cocktails that I enjoy.

**Background**  
The origins of the Toronto date back to 1922, in a book by Robert Vermeire titled [*Cocktails: How to Mix Them*](http://www.amazon.com/Cocktails-How-Them-Robert-Vermeire-ebook/dp/B00B9GR6C4/). In it there was a drink referred to as the Fernet Cocktail. The recipe called for bitters, simple syrup, and **equal parts** of Fernet and either Cognac or rye whisky (and gives measurements in fractions of gills, which is a quarter of a pint)! Following the instructions is a short note about how the cocktail "is much appreciated by the Canadians of Toronto." A similar recipe with equal parts Fernet and whisky appears in *Boothby's World Drinks* from 1930 but renamed the Toronto. The actual Toronto as we now know it, however, first appeared in David Embury's *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks* in 1948. Embury calls for Canadian whisky specifically, but there has been some debate whether or not this cocktail actually originated from Canada. Embury describes the Toronto as "a modified Old-Fashioned \[...\] made with Fernet-Branca, a bitters particularly loved by Italians."

**Recipes**

This cocktail may be made in Old-Fashioned glasses or may be stirred with large cubes of ice and strained into cocktail glasses. In either case, decorate with a twist of orange peel.

**Results**  
This cocktail is quick and easy to make, but offers some deep complexity thanks to the splash of Fernet. I like Embury's characterization of this drink as an Old Fashioned with Fernet used as the bitters, so I tend to stick to the Imbibe recipe (2 oz whiskey, 0.25 oz of both Fernet and simple, no angostura bitters). If you add any more Fernet I feel like it takes over the drink. A little extra simple syrup gives a nice velvety mouthfeel, but I live in Kentucky at the moment, and I like to make my Toronto with bourbon which I usually find sweeter than rye. I think the subtle oakiness of the bourbon really adds a lot. Perhaps it's just that living here has turned me into some kind of bourbon fanboy (it's really hard to live here and not learn to love bourbon). While I absolutely love Fernet, I prefer to just hint at it in this drink instead of having it totally dominate. I tend to forego the angostura bitters as they seem to get lost in even just a quarter ounce of Fernet. I do enjoy it with rye as well, but I find the flavors of a Toronto with rye to be a bit too forward.

It's actually quite a different drink when made with rye, compared to bourbon or Canadian whiskey. Give it a shot both ways and see what you prefer!

**Fernet Branca**  
If you've never had this stuff before, I should warn you that it's not for everyone. It has a very strong flavor. The best way I can describe it is bitter and herbal, with a strong menthol quality; kind of like Jagermeister, but menthol instead of licorice and not sweet. I've heard people say it tastes like mouthwash, cough syrup, or "like licking a koala's asshole". It seems like people either love it or hate it. I've never met anyone that was just on the fence about it. There's also Branca Menta that is sweeter and minty, which I don't particularly care for.

Fernet Branca is a digestif and an amaro (Italian for bitter) that was invented in Milan, Italy in 1845. Harold McGee points out in *On Food and Cooking* that [alcohol molecules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol) have a "split chemical personality" because they have similarities to molecules of fats as well as water. This property makes alcohol a great solvent for volatile, aromatic molecules, and means that it's good at extracting and holding flavors from solid ingredients. So that explains bitters and tinctures. Fernet uses this quality to extract flavors from herbs, flowers, roots, and plants from 5 continents. It's rumored that Fernet Branca purchases nearly three quarters of the world's saffron.

Fernet has a bit of a cult following in parts of the world. The national drink of Argentina is Fernet with Coke. In the US, San Francisco drinks a large portion of the Fernet that is imported (I've heard numbers as high as 75% claimed, but I doubt it's that high). Among those working in the service industry, it's often consumed as a Bartender's Handshake, which is just a shot of Fernet with a ginger ale chaser. I have to say that the ginger ale afterwards does something magical in your mouth. Personally, I usually just sip it instead of shooting it, and don't have any issue drinking it neat with no chaser. Keep in mind that it's a deceptive 39% ABV. I always feel like I can drink this stuff all night, but it does tend to catch up with you.

The intro to [this Munchies episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVZGVoI4eA) kind of gives a decent insight into "Fernet culture". Maybe it's a hipster drink, but I don't care. It's delicious.
