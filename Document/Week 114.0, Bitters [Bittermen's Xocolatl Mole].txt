**Not Cocktail of the Week #114: Conference**  
For the third installment of cocktails from *Death & Co.*, I wanted to share the Conference, an over-the-top “Tiki drink disguised as an Old-Fashioned”. Utilizing four base spirits and two bitters, this is like every take on the Old-Fashioned rolled into one but ends up working surprisingly well. 

**Background**  
Brian Miller is the bartender responsible for coming up with the Conference in 2008, drawing upon his knowledge as “resident scalawag and expert on all things Polynesian”. It is probably best to tell the story behind the Conference in his own words:  

>“One of our servers asked me to make her something stirred and boozy. So I threw four of my favorite spirits into an old-fashioned template, splitting the base four ways. All these brown spirits needed something to tie them together. Avery Glasser (of the bitters company Bittermens) happened to be sitting at the bar, and he suggested trying his mole bitters. It was like lacing up a shoe.”  

**Recipes**

**Results**  
I’ve tasted this cocktail a few times, but I feel like every experience is unique. I think the balance of this drink lies on a razor fine point so any minute differences in measures or dilution can result in distinctly different drinks. Still, there are a few commonalities between them all. Much like the tasting notes from Doug Ford above, my first notes from this drink describe it as having an “earthy spicy nose, fruit and wood flavor, finish bitter with chocolate notes.” A few tastings later and I have reached a consensus on the flavor progression of this drink. The nose of this is very complex and hints at the complexity of the drink itself. It starts with bright lemon up front, shifting to a fruity citrus note in the body, and finishing with spicy rye and earthy notes on the back end. Flavor-wise, describing this as a Tiki drink in disguise is definitely apt as it is difficult to pick out specific flavor notes amongst the mélange. I found that the drink is initially relatively light up front with fruit and mild apple notes. In the body, the whiskies start to assert themselves with bourbon contributing a sweet note and the rye contributing its distinctive spicy note. The finish is primarily of the bitters, with the earthy Xocolatl Mole bitters and spicy Angostura apparent. The flavors parallel the nose with many seamless layers of flavor. As a final note on technique, when stirring a drink served over ice, cut the stirring time down significantly or you will run the risk of overdilution. I might even go so far as to suggest building this drink in the glass and stirring with large ice as I typically do for an Old-Fashioned.  
 
**Variations**  
There’s not much to go with in terms of variations as the Conference already covers so much ground. You might be able to replace a dash of Angostura with a dash of something different, but I would not consider substitutions for the Xocolatl Mole bitters. Their unique earthy spiciness definitely ties everything together and imparts a unique flavor.  

**Cheers!**  
Despite the relatively complex drink, this is a relatively short post. Either way, I hope you’ve enjoyed it and will have the opportunity to give the Conference a try. I think it’s definitely a unique experience and one worth revisiting occasionally with different spirits. I’m tempted to use some of the Westland Sherry Wood I’ve recently picked up in this as I find it has a unique creamy pear flavor that might be intriguing for this drink. I’m still hoping to find some more regular guest contributors; I’ve got a handful that write on a semi-regular basis, but if you are interested in sharing a cocktail you enjoy through NCotW, it would help make these features on /r/cocktails a bit more frequent. Other than that, I hope you all continue to enjoy and support this hobby of mine through your contributions and discussions. I’ve got a couple more Death & Co.  drinks in the queue that I want to share, but until next time, cheers!
