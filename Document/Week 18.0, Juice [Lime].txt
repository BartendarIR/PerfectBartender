**Not Cocktail of the Week #18: Dark ‘n Stormy**  
Although last week’s post was a long and refreshing drink, namely the Pimm’s Cup, since we’ve just had a spell of extraordinarily fine weather in San Francisco, and reportedly even more so in my hometown of Seattle, I thought it would be nice to continue with another drink in the same vein, namely the Dark ‘n Stormy. This is an extraordinarily simple, yet crowd-pleasing drink, requested often by my friends and guests, which require me to stay well-stocked with ginger beer.  

**Background**  
Originating from Bermuda, the Dark ‘n Stormy has no individual credited with its creation, instead it is the likely result of a simple combination of the two ingredients supplied to officers of the British Royal Navy in the late 1800s, namely dark rum and ginger beer. A simple story for a simple cocktail.  
In the late 1970s, Gosling’s trademarked the Dark ‘n Stormy cocktail to protect their interests abroad. Despite the Dark ‘n Stormy serving as Bermuda’s unofficial drink and traditionally utilizing Gosling’s Black Seal Rum, when other rum companies began promoting their rums in America or Europe for use in a Dark ‘n Stormy cocktail, Gosling’s wanted the theoretical right, though presumably never exercised, to prevent others from capitalizing on their cocktail. Technically, there are a few other trademarked cocktails such as the Painkiller and Sazerac, but trying to enforce these trademarks at thousands of individual bars is patently ridiculous. Instead, Gosling’s has taken the strategy to educate and establish their specific recipe as *the* Dark ‘n Stormy, by both making their own brand of ginger beer known as Gosling’s Stormy Ginger Beer, and by selling a [premixed canned version](http://www.goslingsrum.com/darknstormy) of their cocktail which I am very curious to try. 

**Recipes**  
* 2 oz dark rum (traditionally Gosling’s Black Seal)  
* 2-6 oz ginger beer (for extra authenticity, find the Bermudan brand Barritt’s)  
* 0.5 oz lime juice (optional)  
Pour in order over ice into a Collins glass, garnish lime wedge

**Results**  
This is about as simple as it gets and amazingly good on a hot day. If you elect to squeeze the lime into the drink, the nose is the fresh and faintly astringent citrus note that you get from lime. Upon sipping/swigging, the sweet caramel notes of the dark rum enter and are then bolstered by the spicy sweetness of ginger beer before the tingling effervescence refreshes your palate for the next sip. I find the Dark ‘n Stormy an incredibly refreshing drink that always seems to call for a second serving.

**Variations**  
Not much comes to mind as a variation on such a simple cocktail that is comprised of just two ingredients. In the past, I have used Gosling’s Black Seal Rum in a Dark ‘n Stormy, but I actually prefer using spiced rum in a Dark ‘n Stormy to really enhance the spice notes as seen in my album, which although blasphemous, is delicious. Changing the base spirit to vodka results in the classic Moscow Mule cocktail, which was the vessel that introduced America to vodka. Other than my preferred substitution of spiced rum, I’m drawing a blank on variations. If you have any interesting twists on a Dark ‘n Stormy, please share them in the comments.

**Ginger beer? Ginger ale?**  
The most popular brand of ginger ale, Canada Dry, was patented in 1907 by the Canadian chemist John McLaughlin. When I was young, I never really understood why ginger ale was called ginger ale. It never tasted of ginger, maybe more reminiscent of a cream soda minus the vanilla. Given that the ginger ale that we know of today is comprised of carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, and artificial ginger flavor, in retrospect I suppose that my confusion is not very surprising. 
It was not until later in life that I discovered ginger beer, which better retains the flavor profile of ginger. Ginger beer is traditionally comprised of ginger juice, sugar, water, and lemon, which is then fermented by a fungal-bacteria symbiote known as a ginger beer plant. However, most ginger beers you find today are non-alcoholic, carbonated by pressurized carbon dioxide and serving as a soft drink. There are a number of decent ginger beers that have cropped up, such as Fever Tree, but I have found the most easily sourced and economical one (at least here on the West Coast) is Reed’s Extra Ginger Brew which I can always find at a nearby Trader Joe’s. If you are more adventurous and ambitious, you can make your own homemade ginger beer, which I would use Jeffrey Morgenthaler’s recipe found [here](http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2008/how-to-make-your-own-ginger-beer/). I haven’t tried this, but if anyone is willing and able to, I’d love to hear your results.

**Cheers!**  
Hope you all are still enjoying this weekly column on /r/cocktails. I’ve received a lot of appreciation both in the form of comments and in reddit gold, which I am very thankful for. I am very flattered that some people want to thank me in a more tangible fashion, but if you really feel inclined to contribute in a monetary fashion, I would be very happy to take your generous gifts and transform them into either new bar tools (I actually do not own a proper jigger or Yarai glass, and am thinking of upgrading/replacing my Boston shaker) or more cocktail books (I only own four and have nine on my wish list) that would be used for future NCotW posts.  
With that said, comments are always open to your suggestions, feedback, experiences, variations, and questions. If you are interested in writing a guest post on your favorite cocktail, send me a message and I’d be happy to give you the opportunity. Thanks again for all the support.
