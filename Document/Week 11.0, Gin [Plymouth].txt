**Not Cocktail of the Week #11: Negroni**  
I thought I would return and write about another very classic cocktail using Campari for this week’s column. It is a very delicious and important Italian apéritif used in many cocktails and hopefully this will add another to your roster of Campari cocktails.  

**Background**  
In order to discuss the origins of the Negroni, it is important to also be familiar with another very popular cocktail in Italy, the Americano. The Americano is comprised of equal parts Campari and sweet vermouth, topped with soda water, and served on ice. It was concocted in the 1860s by the inventor of Campari, Gaspar Campari, as a delicious way to consume the bitter liqueur bearing his name, and has become popular enough that it can be found premixed as individually bottled servings. Fun trivia fact, the Americano is the first drink James Bond ordered in the original novels, automatically adding another level of classiness.  
In any case, the popularity of the Americano provides the backdrop for the creation of the Negroni. The legend starts revolves around Count Camillo Negroni, an Italian playboy whose extravagant lifestyle led him to be driven out to Canada, where he spent some time as a cattle rancher. Upon his return to Florence in 1912, he became a regular at the Bar Casoni. Having developed a taste for stronger spirits during his time abroad, he asked the bartender, Fosco Scarselli, to fortify the popular Americano by replacing the club soda with gin. Thus a legendary cocktail bearing his name was born. Ultimately, though this story is widely accepted, it is difficult to confirm without documentation. The earliest documentation that Gary Regan was able to find is from the 1955 U.K.B.G Guide to Drinks, published by the U.K. Bartender’s Guild, as referenced in his book, *Joy of Mixology*. Regardless of its origins, this definitely is a timeless classic worth being familiar with and enjoying frequently.

**Recipes**  
The recipe for a Negroni is really not debatable and is the same everywhere you look. It’s so simple and easy to remember you could probably mix this in your sleep. The real variable is how much of it you want.   
* 1 part gin (Plymouth gin this time)  
* 1 part sweet vermouth (Dolin Rouge is my usual)  
* 1 part Campari  
Stirred on ice, garnish with orange twist/peel (optionally flamed for extra flair)  
Served up or on the rocks

**Results**  
Although especially well-suited for sipping in warm weather, I often find myself enjoying the Negroni year round. The first time I made a Negroni, I was unaccustomed to such bold flavors and actually didn’t enjoy it much, but as I’ve gained both experience and familiarity with cocktails, I have come to appreciate and recommend it as a sophisticated, yet simple cocktail. It is hard to describe the flavor of a Negroni as it has so many different pieces that somehow marry together very beautifully. I find the combination of juniper and citrus notes from the gin are tempered by the sweet vermouth, which segue seamlessly into the sweet and bracing bitterness of Campari. The long-lasting bitter finish provides a pleasant drying sensation on the palate that encourages another sip. I must guiltily admit that simply writing about the flavor of a Negroni inspired me to go fix myself one and it is delicious.  

**Variations**  
The Negroni serves as a solid and straightforward basis for some variation. The Campari can easily be substituted for your choice of bitter apéritif/amaro, with some slight tweaking to adjust for sweetness. One popular substitution is Cynar, but I’m sure most Italian amaro could easily take its place. Unfortunately, I am still expanding my selection of these, so if you have any great Negroni variations, it’d be great to share them in the comments. Similarly, one can play with different brands of sweet vermouth, which will lend their unique profile to this cocktail. It can be especially delicious and rich when using the perennial favorite Carpano Antica, which is how I consumed a great majority of my bottle, but if anyone has any other particularly good combinations that they favor, feel free to share it for our collective appreciation.  
I am familiar with one rather tasty variation, which was specifically concocted by the makers of Hendrick’s gin known as the Unusual (or Cheeky) Negroni. This variation is a much lighter cousin to the Negroni and can be especially well suited to introduce a new cocktail drinker unaccustomed to the bracing bitterness of Campari. I find this cocktail very refreshing and a great sip on a warm day.  
*Unusual Negroni*  
* 1 part Hendrick’s gin (a much lighter and floral gin)  
* 1 part Aperol (a milder and more citrus-forward relative of Campari)  
* 1 part Lillet Blanc (a fortified wine similar to dry vermouth, infused with orange peels and quinine.  
Stirred on ice, garnish with orange slice  
Served up or on the rocks  

**Cheers!**  
Hope you’re all still enjoying this regular feature. I just planned out the next couple months in advance this week, so stay tuned for more delicious cocktails!
