**Not Cocktail of the Week #92: Charlie Chaplin**  
First off, thanks to /u/Spodyody for doing a great job with his guest post on the [Algonquin](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2i16yn/ncotw_91_algonquin/) last week, as I was out of town for a conference. For this week’s cocktail, I want to return to sloe gin. You may recall from my post on the [Sloe Gin Fizz](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2hcybr/not_cocktail_of_the_week_90_sloe_gin_fizz/), I first had my taste of sloe gin at the Alembic a long time ago, specifically in the form of a Charlie Chaplin. It was a memorable experience that inspired me to eventually acquire sloe gin for myself and now having done so, I want to share the Charlie Chaplin as this week’s NCotW. 

**Background**  
The Charlie Chaplin, obviously named after the famous silent film actor, is an original drink concocted in the 1920s at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel and published in Albert Stevens Crockett’s *Old Waldorf Bar Book* in 1935. The Waldorf-Astoria hotel was an important place in cocktail history, with bartenders there inventing the [Bronx](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/221kjr/not_cocktail_of_the_week_65_bronx_income_tax/) cocktail, popularizing the [Clover Club](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1go8m1/not_cocktail_of_the_week_24_clover_club/), potentially inventing the [Jack Rose](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1bnysd/not_cocktail_of_the_week_13_jack_rose/), and creating the [Hotel Nacional Special](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2dgqc3/not_cocktail_of_the_week_84_tiki_edition_hotel/) (albeit in Cuba due to Prohibition). 

**Recipes**  
*The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*, David Embury, 1948  
* 2 parts Lime Juice  
* 3 parts Sloe Gin  
* 3 parts Apricot Brandy  
Shake with crushed or cracked ice. The original recipe [?] for this drinks calls for three times as much sloe gin as brandy, which is far too sweet a drink for a cocktail. 

*The Craft of the Cocktail*, Dale Degroff, 2002  
* 1 oz Marie Brizard Apry or other apricot brandy  
* 1 oz sloe gin  
* 1 oz fresh lime juice  
* lime peel, for garnish  
Shake all the ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled martini glass. Garnish with the lime peel.  

*The Joy of Mixology*, Gary Regan, 2003  
* 1 oz apricot brandy  
* 1 oz sloe gin  
* 1 oz fresh lime juice  
Shake and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.

**Results**  
At first glance, a cocktail comprised primarily of sloe gin and apricot brandy seems like it would be overly sweet, and in most cases you would be correct. As mentioned in the previous post on the Sloe Gin Fizz, it’s taken a long time for good sloe gin to become available on shelves in the United States. Much like the difference between the artificially dyed and flavored imitation Maraschino cherry versus the real Luxardo Maraschino cherry, a similar chasm exists between the syrupy sweet “sloe gin” offerings from DeKuyper or Hiram Walker versus the authentic sloe gins from Plymouth or Hayman’s, as well as the artificial apricot flavored liqueurs versus the high quality offerings from Rothman & Winter or Marie Brizard. I am using the Spirit Works sloe gin that I recently acquired with Rothman & Winter Orchard Apricot.  
The resulting Charlie Chaplin has an amazingly intoxicating aroma that I found incredibly appropriate for the slow creep into autumn. It has clear notes of stone fruit and berry, a bright edge of citrus, and I was excited to detect the hint of almond attributed to the infusion of pits of the sloe berry. This combination of scents brings to mind warm fruit pies that I associate with autumn. In the mouth it starts with sweet apricot and stone fruit (possibly plum), which I would hazard is due to the close relation of sloe berry with plum. Halfway through, the cocktail pivots on the sloe berry flavor to a more tart and astringent character with a nearly tannic quality from the sloe berry coming forward combining with the dry citrus character I associate with lime. Ironically, I found my Charlie Chaplin a hair too tart, possibly because the ingredients I’m using are relatively low in sugar. I first tried adding 0.25 oz simple syrup, which pushed it over to being a little too sweet, but found that a barspoon of simple syrup achieved the balance I wanted. This is obviously very dependent on both the ingredient selection and personal taste. 

**Sloe Gin and Apricot Brandy**  
If you missed my previous discussion on sloe gin from two weeks ago, find it in my post on the [Sloe Gin Fizz](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/2hcybr/not_cocktail_of_the_week_90_sloe_gin_fizz/). I previously wrote about apricot brandy in a post on the [Claridge](http://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1fqiys/not_cocktail_of_the_week_22_claridge/) over a year ago, so if you want to learn more about that ingredient and another great cocktail using it, you can find it there.  

**Cheers!**  
Thanks for reading this week’s post, in case it isn’t obvious, I’ve really been enjoying sloe gin this autumn. Next week I’ll be out of town again (this time for vacation), so my friend /u/ems88 will be sharing a great modern classic in my stead.
